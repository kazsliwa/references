	Abstract = {The central kiloparsec region of the Andromeda galaxy is relatively gas poor, while the interstellar medium appears to be concentrated in a ring-like structure at about 10 kpc radius. The central gas depletion has been attributed to a possible head-on collision 200 Myr ago, supported by the existence of an offset inner ring of warm dust. We present new IRAM 30 m radio telescope observations of the molecular gas in the central region, and the detection of CO and its isotopes 13CO(2-1) and C18O(2-1), together with the dense gas tracers, HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0). A systematic study of the observed peak temperatures with non-local thermal equilibrium simulations shows that the detected lines trace dense regions with nH2 in the range 2.5 × 104-5.6 × 105 cm-3, while the gas is very clumpy with a beam filling factor of 0.5-2 × 10-2. This is compatible with the dust mass derived from the far-infrared emission, assuming a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01 with a typical clump size of 2 pc. We also show that the gas is optically thin in all lines except for 12CO(1-0) and 12CO(2-1), CO lines are close to their thermal equilibrium condition at 17-20 K, the molecular hydrogen density is larger than critical, and HCN and HCO+ lines have a subthermal excitation temperature of 9 K with a density smaller than critical. The average 12CO/13CO line ratio is high (~21), and close to the 12CO/C18O ratio (~30) that was measured in the north-western region and estimated in the south-east stacking. The fact that the optically thin 13CO and C18O lines have comparable intensities means that the secondary element 13C is depleted with respect to the primary 12C, as is expected just after a recent star formation. This suggests that there has been a recent starburst in the central region, supporting the head-on collision scenario.

	Abstract = {Using the ARO KP 12 m telescope, we have carried out a CO(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) survey of the central regions of 113 ``normal'' spiral galaxies (i.e., unperturbed and with little or no nuclear activity). Our sample spans the whole range of morphological types (T = 1-7), with distances up to 75 Mpc. The detection rates for the observed objects are 99.1% for CO(1-0) and 75.2% for 13CO(1-0), respectively. For three of the targets in our sample (i.e., NGC 0891, NGC 2903, and NGC 3521), we also carry out 13CO(1-0) mapping along their major axes, which, combined with data from the literature, reveal differences in their molecular gas properties. Analysis of the beam-matched line intensity ratios of CO(1-0)/13CO(1-0) (hereafter {R}1312) indicates that for ``normal'' spiral galaxies the scatter in {R}1312 is of ≈x3, and has an average value (including upper limits) of 10.4 $\pm$ 0.4 (in contrast with the values of 3-5 in typical giant molecular clouds and 13 $\pm$ 6 in Starburst Galaxies). No significant correlations (at the ≥2σ level) are found between {R}1312 and the total far-infrared (FIR) luminosity, the FIR colors, and the fraction of area sampled in the disk of each galaxy. There is a tentative (1.4σ significance) correlation between {R}1312 and morphological type along the Hubble sequence. The observed scatter in {R}1312 can be explained by intrinsic variations among the CO conversion factors. The observations presented in this work, which include the most extensive 13CO(1-0) extragalactic survey published so far on ``normal'' spiral galaxies are ideally suited for use in recovering the ``missing'' flux of interferometers with elements of similar dish sizes.},

	Abstract = {We present a line survey of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy Arp 220, taken with the newly installed SEPIA (Swedish-European Southern Observatory PI receiver for APEX) Band 5 instrument on APEX (Atacama Pathfinder Experiment). We illustrate the capacity of SEPIA to detect the 183.3 GHz H2O 31,3-22,0 line against the atmospheric H2O absorption feature. We confirm the previous detection of the HCN(2-1) line, and detect new transitions of standard dense gas tracers such as HNC(2-1), HCO+(2-1), CS(4-3), C34S(4-3) and HC3N(20-19). We also detect HCN(2-1) v2 = 1 and the 193.5 GHz methanol (4-3) group for the first time. The absence of time variations in the megamaser water line compared to previous observations seems to rule out an AGN nuclear origin for the line. It could, on the contrary, favour a thermal origin instead, but also possibly be a sign that the megamaser emission is associated with star-forming cores washed out in the beam. We finally discuss how the new transitions of HCN, HNC and HCO+ refine our knowledge of the interstellar medium physical conditions in Arp 220.},

	Abstract = {Extragalactic observations of water emission can provide valuable insights into the excitation of the interstellar medium. In addition, extragalactic megamasers are powerful probes of kinematics close to active nuclei. Therefore, it is paramount to determine the true origin of the water emission, whether it is excited by processes close to an AGN or in star-forming regions. We use ALMA Band 5 science verification observations to analyse the emission of the 183 GHz water line in Arp 220 on sub-arcsecond scales, in conjunction with new ALMA Band 7 data at 325 GHz. Specifically, the nature of the process leading to the excitation of emission at these water lines is studied in this context. Supplementary 22 GHz VLA observations are used to better constrain the parameter space in the excitation modelling of the water lines. We detect 183 GHz H2O and 325 GHz water emission towards the two compact nuclei at the center of Arp 220, being brighter in Arp 220 West. The emission at these two frequencies is compared to previous single-dish data and does not show evidence of variability. The 183 and 325 GHz lines show similar spectra and kinematics, but the 22 GHz profile is significantly different in both nuclei due to a blend with an NH3 absorption line. Our findings suggest that the most likely scenario to cause the observed water emission in Arp 220 is a large number of independent masers originating from numerous star-forming regions.},

	Abstract = {We have imaged the dense star-forming regions of Arp 220 and NGC 6240 in the 3 mm band transitions of CO, HCN, HCO+, HNC, and CS at 0.″5--0.″8 resolution using CARMA. Our data set images all these lines at similar resolutions and high sensitivity, and can be used to derive line ratios of faint high excitation lines. In both the nuclei of Arp 220, the HCN/HNC ratios suggest chemistry of X-ray Dominated Regions (XDRs)---a likely signature of an active galactic nucleus. In NGC 6240, there is no evidence of XDR type chemistry, but there the bulk of the molecular gas is concentrated between the nuclei rather than on them. We calculated molecular H2 densities from excitation analysis of each of the molecular species. It appears that the abundances of HNC and HCO+ in Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies may be significantly different from those in galactic molecular clouds. The derived H2 volume densities are ∼5 × 104 cm‑3 in the Arp 220 nuclei and ∼104 cm‑3 in NGC 6240.},

	Abstract = {We present a new, detailed analysis of the morphologies and molecular gas fractions (MGFs) for a complete sample of 65 local luminous infrared galaxies from Great Observatories All-Sky Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRG) Survey using high resolution I-band images from The Hubble Space Telescope, the University of Hawaii 2.2 m Telescope and the Pan-STARRS1 Survey. Our classification scheme includes single undisturbed galaxies, minor mergers, and major mergers, with the latter divided into five distinct stages from pre-first pericenter passage to final nuclear coalescence. We find that major mergers of molecular gas-rich spirals clearly play a major role for all sources with {L}{IR}\gt {10}11.5{L}⊙ ; however, below this luminosity threshold, minor mergers and secular processes dominate. Additionally, galaxies do not reach {L}{IR}\gt {10}12.0{L}⊙ until late in the merger process when both disks are near final coalescence. The mean MGF ({MGF} = {M}{{{H}}2}/({M}* +{M}{{{H}}2})) for non-interacting and early-stage major merger LIRGs is 18 $\pm$ 2%, which increases to 33 $\pm$ 3%, for intermediate stage major merger LIRGs, consistent with the hypothesis that, during the early-mid stages of major mergers, most of the initial large reservoir of atomic gas (HI) at large galactocentric radii is swept inward where it is converted into molecular gas (H2).},

	Abstract = {We observe Arp 220, the nearest ultra-luminous infrared galaxy, over 4 GHz in the K and Ka bands, providing constraints for the kinematics and morphology, and identifying molecular species on scales resolving both nuclei (0.″6 or 230 pc). We detect multiple molecular species, including hydroxyl (OH {}2{{{\Pi }}}3/2J=9/2F=4-4;5-5) in both cores, and tentatively detect H2O(615-523) at ˜21.84 GHz in both nuclei, indicating the likely presence of maser emission. The observed frequency range also contains metastable ammonia transitions from (J, K) = (1, 1)-(5, 5), as well as the (9, 9) inversion line; together, they are a well-known thermometer of dense molecular gas. Furthermore, the non-metastable (4, 2) and (10, 9), and possibly the (3, 1), lines are also detected. We apply a standard temperature analysis to Arp 220; however, the analysis is complicated in that standard local thermal equilibrium (LTE) assumptions do not hold. There are indications that a substantial fraction of ammonia could be in the non-metastable transitions, as opposed to only the metastable ones. Thus, the non-metastable transitions could be essential to constraining the temperature. We compare all of these data to ALMA observations of this source, confirming the outflow previously observed by other tracers in both nuclei.},

We describe the observation, reduction, and combination of the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) and IRAM-30 m "short spacing" data. The final data cube attains 1.''1 resolution over the ~270'' × 170'' field of view, with sensitivity to all spatial scales from the combination of PdBI and IRAM-30 m data, and a brightness sensitivity of 0.4 K (1σ) in each 5 km s-1-wide channel map. We find a CO luminosity of 9 × 108 K km s-1 pc2, corresponding to a molecular gas mass of 4 × 109 M ⊙ for a standard CO-to-H2 conversion factor. Unexpectedly, we find that a large fraction of this emission, (50 $\pm$ 10)%, arises mostly from spatial scales larger than 36'' ~= 1.3 kpc. Through a series of tests, we demonstrate that this extended emission does not result from a processing artifact. We discuss its origin in light of the stellar component, the 12CO/13CO ratio, and the difference between the kinematics and structure of the PdBI-only and hybrid synthesis (PdBI + IRAM-30 m) images. The extended emission is consistent with a thick, diffuse disk of molecular gas with a typical scale height of ~200 pc, substructured in unresolved filaments that fill ~0.1% of the volume.},

	Abstract = {Emission is detected from the two lowest rotational transitions of CO-17 from NGC 253, M 82, and, tentatively, IC 342. Observations of the corresponding transitions of C(O-18) were used to determine O-18/O-17 isotope ratios, which are 8.3 (+/- 1.3) toward M 82, 10 (+/- 3) toward NGC 253 and greater than about 5.5 toward IC 342. These values are much higher than the about 3.6 found in Galactic sources (e.g., Wannier 1980; Penzias 1981), and two are definitely larger than the solar system ratio, 5.5. The results can be understood if, during a previous epoch of star formation, high-mass stars were preferentially formed near the centers of NGC 253 and M 82, if it is assumed that O-18 is mainly produced in high mass stars. This leads to an underabundance of O-17 relative to O-18. This interpretation is also consistent with the high ratios of (C-12)O/(C-13)O observed in NGC 253 and M 82, which suggest an underabundance of C-13.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We investigate the fueling and the feedback of star formation and nuclear activity in NGC 1068, a nearby (D = 14 Mpc) Seyfert 2 barred galaxy, by analyzing the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas in the disk. We aim to understand if and how gas accretion can self-regulate. 
Methods: We have used the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to map the emission of a set of dense molecular gas (n(H2) ≃ 105 - 6 cm-3) tracers (CO(3-2), CO(6-5), HCN(4-3), HCO+(4-3), and CS(7-6)) and their underlying continuum emission in the central r ~ 2 kpc of NGC 1068 with spatial resolutions ~0.3″ - 0.5″ (~20-35 pc for the assumed distance of D = 14 Mpc). 
Results: The sensitivity and spatial resolution of ALMA give an unprecedented detailed view of the distribution and kinematics of the dense molecular gas (n(H2) ≥ 105 - 6cm-3) in NGC 1068. Molecular line and dust continuum emissions are detected from a r ~ 200 pc off-centered circumnuclear disk (CND), from the 2.6 kpc-diameter bar region, and from the r ~ 1.3 kpc starburst (SB) ring. Most of the emission in HCO+, HCN, and CS stems from the CND. Molecular line ratios show dramatic order-of-magnitude changes inside the CND that are correlated with the UV/X-ray illumination by the active galactic nucleus (AGN), betraying ongoing feedback. We used the dust continuum fluxes measured by ALMA together with NIR/MIR data to constrain the properties of the putative torus using CLUMPY models and found a torus radius of 20+6-10pc. The Fourier decomposition of the gas velocity field indicates that rotation is perturbed by an inward radial flow in the SB ring and the bar region. However, the gas kinematics from r ~ 50 pc out to r ~ 400 pc reveal a massive (Mmol~ 2.7+0.9-1.2 × 107 M⊙) outflow in all molecular tracers. The tight correlation between the ionized gas outflow, the radio jet, and the occurrence of outward motions in the disk suggests that the outflow is AGN driven. 
Conclusions: The molecular outflow is likely launched when the ionization cone of the narrow line region sweeps the nuclear disk. The outflow rate estimated in the CND, dM/dt~ 63+21-37 M⊙ yr-1, is an order of magnitude higher than the star formation rate at these radii, confirming that the outflow is AGN driven. The power of the AGN is able to account for the estimated momentum and kinetic luminosity of the outflow. The CND mass load rate of the CND outflow implies a very short gas depletion timescale of ≤1 Myr. The CND gas reservoir is likely replenished on longer timescales by efficient gas inflow from the outer disk.},

	Abstract = {High resolution submm observations are important in probing the morphology, column density and dynamics of obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs). With high resolution (0.06 x 0.05) ALMA 690 GHz observations we have found bright (TB >80 K) and compact (FWHM 10x7 pc) CO 6-5 line emission in the nucleus of the extremely radio-quiet galaxy NGC1377. The integrated CO 6-5 intensity is aligned with the previously discovered jet/outflow of NGC1377 and is tracing the dense (n>1e4 cm-3), hot gas at the base of the outflow. The velocity structure is complex and shifts across the jet/outflow are discussed in terms of jet-rotation or separate, overlapping kinematical components. High velocity gas (deltaV +-145 km/s) is detected inside r<2-3 pc and we suggest that it is emerging from an inclined rotating disk or torus of position angle PA=140+-20 deg with a dynamical mass of approx 3e6 Msun. This mass is consistent with that of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), as inferred from the M-sigma relation. The gas mass of the proposed disk/torus constitutes <3% of the nuclear dynamical mass. In contrast to the intense CO 6-5 line emission, we do not detect dust continuum with an upper limit of S(690GHz)<2mJy. The corresponding, 5 pc, H2 column density is estimated to N(H2)<3e23 cm-2, which is inconsistent with a Compton Thick (CT) source. We discuss the possibility that CT obscuration may be occuring on small (subparsec) or larger scales. From SED fitting we suggest that half of the IR emission of NGC1377 is nuclear and the rest (mostly the far-infrared (FIR)) is more extended. The extreme radio quietness, and the lack of emission from other star formation tracers, raise questions on the origin of the FIR emission. We discuss the possibility that it is arising from the dissipation of shocks in the molecular jet/outflow or from irradiation by the nuclear source along the poles.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) 108-, 233-, 352-, and 691-GHz continuum observations and Very Large Array (VLA) 4.81- and 8.36-GHz observations of the nearby luminous merger remnant NGC 1614. By analyzing the beam (1{^''.}0 × 1{^''.}0) and uv (≥45 kλ) matched ALMA and VLA maps, we find that the deconvolved source size of lower-frequency emission (≤108 GHz) is more compact (420 pc × 380 pc) compared to the higher-frequency emission (≥233 GHz) (560 pc × 390 pc), suggesting different physical origins for the continuum emission. Based on a spectral energy distribution (SED) model for a dusty starburst galaxy, it is found that the SED can be explained by three components: (1) non-thermal synchrotron emission (traced in the 4.81- and 8.36-GHz continua), (2) thermal free-free emission (traced in the 108-GHz continuum), and (3) thermal dust emission (traced in the 352- and 691-GHz continua). We also present the spatially resolved (sub-kpc scale) Kennicutt-Schmidt relation of NGC 1614. The result suggests a systematically shorter molecular gas depletion time in NGC 1614 (average τgas of 49-77 Myr and 70-226 Myr at the starburst ring and the outer region, respectively) than that of normal disk galaxies (˜2 Gyr) and a mid-stage merger VV 114 (= 0.1-1 Gyr). This implies that the star formation activities in (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies are efficiently enhanced as the merger stage proceeds, which is consistent with the results from high-resolution numerical merger simulations.},

	Abstract = {We report the detection of two CH3OH lines (JK = 2K--1K and 3K--2K) between the progenitor's disks (``Overlap'') of the mid-stage merging galaxy VV 114 obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 and Band 4. The detected CH3OH emission shows an extended filamentary structure (∼3 kpc) across the progenitor's disks with relatively large velocity width (FWZI ∼ 150 km s‑1). The emission is only significant in the ``overlap'' and not detected in the two merging nuclei. Assuming optically thin emission and local thermodynamic equilibrium, we found the CH3OH column density relative to H2 ({X}{{CH}3{OH}}) peaks at the ``Overlap'' (∼8 × 10‑9), which is almost an order of magnitude larger than that at the eastern nucleus. We suggest that kpc-scale shocks driven by galaxy--galaxy collision may play an important role to enhance the CH3OH abundance at the ``Overlap.'' This scenario is consistent with shock-induced large velocity dispersion components of ionized gas that have been detected in optical wavelength at the same region. Conversely, low {X}{{CH}3{OH}} at the nuclear regions might be attributed to the strong photodissociation by nuclear starbursts and/or a putative active galactic nucleus, or inefficient production of CH3OH on dust grains due to initial high-temperature conditions (i.e., desorption of the precursor molecule, CO, into gas phase before forming CH3OH on dust grains). These ALMA observations demonstrate that CH3OH is a unique tool to address kpc-scale shock-induced gas dynamics and star formation in merging galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution (1.″0) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of CO (1--0) and CO (2--1) rotational transitions toward the nearby IR-luminous merger NGC 1614 supplemented with ALMA archival data of CO (3--2) and CO (6--5) transitions. The CO (6--5) emission arises from the starburst ring (central 590 pc in radius), while the lower-J CO lines are distributed over the outer disk (∼3.3 kpc in radius). Radiative transfer and photon-dominated region (PDR) modeling reveals that the starburst ring has a single warmer gas component with more a intense far-ultraviolet radiation field ({n}{{{H}}2}∼ {10}4.6 cm‑3, {T}{kin}∼ 42 K, and {G}0∼ {10}2.7) relative to the outer disk ({n}{{{H}}2}∼ {10}5.1 cm‑3, {T}{kin}∼ 22 K, and {G}0∼ {10}0.9). A two-phase molecular interstellar medium with a warm and cold (>70 and ∼19 K) component is also an applicable model for the starburst ring. A possible source for heating the warm gas component is mechanical heating due to stellar feedback rather than PDR. Furthermore, we find evidence for non-circular motions along the north--south optical bar in the lower-J CO images, suggesting a cold gas inflow. We suggest that star formation in the starburst ring is sustained by the bar-driven cold gas inflow and that starburst activities radiatively and mechanically power the CO excitation. The absence of a bright active galactic nucleus can be explained by a scenario where cold gas accumulating on the starburst ring is exhausted as the fuel for star formation or is launched as an outflow before being able to feed to the nucleus.},

The internal gas distribution and kinematics of both galactic nuclei are well resolved for the first time. In the west nucleus, the major gas and dust emission extends out to 0.″2 radius (74 pc); the central resolution element shows a strong peak in the dust emission but a factor of 3 dip in the CO line emission. In this nucleus, the dust is apparently optically thick ({τ }2.6{mm}∼ 1) at λ =2.6 {mm} with a dust brightness temperature of ∼147 K. The column of interstellar matter at this nucleus is {N}{{H}2}≥slant 2× {10}26 cm‑2, corresponding to ∼900 gr cm‑2. The east nucleus is more elongated with radial extent 0.″3 or ∼111 pc. The derived kinematics of the nuclear disks provide a good fit to the line profiles, yielding the emissivity distributions, the rotation curves, and velocity dispersions. In the west nucleus, there is evidence of a central Keplerian component requiring a central mass of 8 × 108 {M}{\.o} . The intrinsic widths of the emission lines are {{Δ }}v({FWHM})=250 (west) and 120 (east) km s‑1. Given the very short dissipation timescales for turbulence (≲105 years), we suggest that the line widths may be due to semicoherent motions within the nuclear disks. The symmetry of the nuclear disk structures is impressive, implying the merger timescale is significantly longer than the rotation period of the disks.},

	Abstract = {We use the IRAM Large Program EMPIRE and new high-resolution ALMA data to measure 13CO(1-0)/C18O(1-0) intensity ratios across nine nearby spiral galaxies. These isotopologues of 12CO are typically optically thin across most of the area in galaxy disks, and this ratio allows us to gauge their relative abundance due to chemistry or stellar nucleosynthesis effects. Resolved 13CO/C18O gradients across normal galaxies have been rare due to the faintness of these lines. We find a mean 13CO/C18O ratio of 6.0 $\pm$ 0.9 for the central regions of our galaxies. This agrees well with results in the Milky Way, but differs from results for starburst galaxies (3.4 $\pm$ 0.9) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (1.1 $\pm$ 0.4). In our sample, the 13CO/C18O ratio consistently increases with increasing galactocentric radius and decreases with increasing star formation rate surface density. These trends could be explained if the isotopic abundances are altered by fractionation; the sense of the trends also agrees with those expected for carbon and oxygen isotopic abundance variations due to selective enrichment by massive stars.},

	Abstract = {Full range Herschel/PACS spectroscopy of the (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies NGC 4418 and Arp 220, observed as part of the SHINING key programme, reveals high excitation in H2O, OH, HCN, and NH3. In NGC 4418, absorption lines were detected with Elower > 800 K (H2O), 600 K (OH), 1075 K (HCN), and 600 K (NH3), while in Arp 220 the excitation is somewhat lower. While outflow signatures in moderate excitation lines are seen in Arp 220 as have been seen in previous studies, in NGC 4418 the lines tracing its outer regions are redshifted relative to the nucleus, suggesting an inflow with {\.M} ≲ 12 M⊙ yr-1. Both galaxies have compact and warm (Tdust ≳ 100 K) nuclear continuum components, together with a more extended and colder component that is much more prominent and massive in Arp 220. A chemical dichotomy is found in both sources: on the one hand, the nuclear regions have high H2O abundances, ~10-5, and high HCN/H2O and HCN/NH3 column density ratios of 0.1-0.4 and 2-5, respectively, indicating a chemistry typical of evolved hot cores where grain mantle evaporation has occurred. On the other hand, the high OH abundance, with OH/H2O ratios of ~0.5, indicates the effects of X-rays and/or cosmic rays. The nuclear media have high surface brightnesses (≳1013 L⊙/kpc2) and are estimated to be very thick (NH ≳ 1025 cm-2). While NGC 4418 shows weak absorption in H218O and 18OH, with a 16O-to-18O ratio of ≳250-500, the relatively strong absorption of the rare isotopologues in Arp 220 indicates 18O enhancement, with 16O-to-18O of 70-130. Further away from the nuclear regions, the H2O abundance decreases to ≲10-7 and the OH/H2O ratio is reversed relative to the nuclear region to 2.5-10. Despite the different scales and morphologies of NGC 4418, Arp 220, and Mrk 231, preliminary evidence is found for an evolutionary sequence from infall, hot-core like chemistry, and solar oxygen isotope ratio to high velocity outflow, disruption of the hot core chemistry and cumulative high mass stellar processing of 18O.},

@article{Koenig2016a,
	Abstract = {Aims: Observations of the molecular gas over scales of ~0.5 to several kpc provide crucial information on how molecular gas moves through galaxies, especially in mergers and interacting systems, where it ultimately reaches the galaxy center, accumulates, and feeds nuclear activity. Studying the processes involved in the gas transport is one of the important steps forward to understand galaxy evolution. 
Methods: 12CO, 13CO, and C18O 1-0 high-sensitivity ALMA observations (~4'' × 2'') were used to assess the properties of the large-scale molecular gas reservoir and its connection to the circumnuclear molecular ring in the merger NGC 1614. Specifically, the role of excitation and abundances were studied in this context. We also observed the molecular gas high-density tracers CN and CS. 
Results: The spatial distributions of the detected 12CO 1-0 and 13CO 1-0 emission show significant differences. 12CO traces the large-scale molecular gas reservoir, which is associated with a dust lane that harbors infalling gas, and extends into the southern tidal tails. 13CO emission is for the first time detected in the large-scale dust lane. In contrast to 12CO, its line emission peaks between the dust lane and the circumnuclear molecular ring. A 12CO-to-13CO 1-0 intensity ratio map shows high values in the ring region (~30) that are typical for the centers of luminous galaxy mergers and even more extreme values in the dust lane (>45). Surprisingly, we do not detect C18O emission in NGC 1614, but we do observe gas emitting the high-density tracers CN and CS. 
Conclusions: We find that the 12CO-to-13CO 1-0 line ratio in NGC 1614 changes from >45 in the 2 kpc dust lane to ~30 in the starburst nucleus. This drop in ratio with decreasing radius is consistent with the molecular gas in the dust lane being kept in a diffuse, unbound state while it is being funneled toward the nucleus. This also explains why there are no (or very faint) signs of star formation in the dust lane, despite its high 12CO luminosity. In the inner 1.5 kpc, the gas is compressed into denser and most likely self-gravitating clouds (traced by CN and CS emission), allowing it to power the intense central starburst. We find a high 16O-to-18O abundance ratio in the starburst region (≥900), typical of quiescent disk gas. This is surprising because by now, the starburst is expected to have enriched the nuclear interstellar medium in 18O relative to 16O. We suggest that the massive inflow of gas may be partially responsible for the low 18O/16O abundance since it will dilute the starburst enrichment with unprocessed gas from greater radial distances. The 12CO-to-13CO abundance of >90 we infer from the line ratio is consistent with this scenario. It suggests that the nucleus of NGC 1614 is in a transient phase of its evolution where the starburst and the nuclear growth is still being fuelled by returning gas from the minor merger event.},

	Abstract = {Context. The luminous infrared galaxy Zw 049.057 contains a compact obscured nucleus where a considerable amount of the galaxy's luminosity is generated. This nucleus contains a dusty environment that is rich in molecular gas. One approach to probing this kind of environment and to revealing what is hidden behind the dust is to study the rotational lines of molecules that couple well with the infrared radiation emitted by the dust. 
Aims: We probe the physical conditions in the core of Zw 049.057 and establish the nature of its nuclear power source (starburst or active galactic nucleus). 
Methods: We observed Zw 049.057 with the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) and the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) onboard the Herschel Space Observatory in rotational lines of H2O, H218O, OH, 18OH, and [O I]. We modeled the unresolved core of the galaxy using a spherically symmetric radiative transfer code. To account for the different excitation requirements of the various molecular transitions, we use multiple components and different physical conditions. 
Results: We present the full high-resolution SPIRE FTS spectrum of Zw 049.057, along with relevant spectral scans in the PACS range. We find that a minimum of two different components (nuclear and extended) are required in order to account for the rich molecular line spectrum of Zw 049.057. The nuclear component has a radius of 10-30 pc, a very high infrared surface brightness (~1014L⊙kpc-2), warm dust (Td > 100 K), and a very large H2 column density (NH2 = 1024-1025 cm-2). The modeling also indicates high nuclear H2O (~5 × 10-6) and OH (~4 × 10-6) abundances relative to H2 as well as a low 16O/18O-ratio of 50-100. We also find a prominent infall signature in the [O I] line. We tentatively detect a 500 km s-1 outflow in the H2O 313 → 202 line. 
Conclusions: The high surface brightness of the core indicates the presence of either a buried active galactic nucleus or a very dense nuclear starburst. The estimated column density towards the core of Zw 049.057 indicates that it is Compton-thick, making a buried X-ray source difficult to detect even in hard X-rays. We discuss the elevated H2O abundance in the nucleus in the context of warm grain and gas-phase chemistry. The H2O abundance is comparable to that of other compact (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies such as NGC 4418 and Arp 220 - and also to hot cores in the Milky Way. The enhancement of 18O is a possible indicator that the nucleus of Zw 049.057 is in a similar evolutionary stage as the nuclei of Arp 220 - and more advanced than NGC 4418. We discuss the origin of the extreme nuclear gas concentration and note that the infalling gas detected in [O I] implies that the gas reservoir in the central region of Zw 049.057 is being replenished. If confirmed, the H2O outflow suggests that the nucleus is in a stage of rapid evolution.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We probe the physical conditions in the core of Arp 299A and try to put constraints on the nature of its nuclear power source. 
Methods: We used Herschel Space Observatory far-infrared and submillimeter observations of H2O and OH rotational lines in Arp 299A to create a multi-component model of the galaxy. In doing this, we employed a spherically symmetric radiative transfer code. 
Results: Nine H2O lines in absorption and eight in emission, as well as four OH doublets in absorption and one in emission, are detected in Arp 299A. No lines of the 18O isotopologues, which have been seen in compact obscured nuclei of other galaxies, are detected. The absorption in the ground state OH 2Π3/2-2Π3/2(5/2)+-(3/2)- doublet at 119 μm is found redshifted by 175 km s-1 compared with other OH and H2O lines, suggesting a low excitation inflow. We find that at least two components are required in order to account for the excited molecular line spectrum. The inner component has a radius of 20-25 pc, a very high infrared surface brightness (≳3 × 1013L⊙kpc-2), warm dust (Td > 90 K), and a large H2 column density (NH2 > 1024 cm-2). The modeling also indicates high nuclear H2O (1-5 × 10-6) and OH (0.5-5 × 10-5) abundances relative to H nuclei. The outer component is larger (50-100 pc) with slightly cooler dust (70-90 K) and molecular abundances that are approximately one order of magnitude lower. In addition to the two components that account for the excited OH and H2O lines, we require a much more extended inflowing component to account for the OH 2Π3/2-2Π3/2(5/2)+-(3/2)- doublet at 119 μm. 
Conclusions: The Compton-thick nature of the core makes it difficult to determine the nature of the buried power source, but the high surface brightness indicates that it is an active galactic nucleus and/or a dense nuclear starburst. Our results are consistent with a composite source. The high OH/H2O ratio in the nucleus indicates that ion-neutral chemistry induced by X-rays or cosmic-rays is important. Finally we find a lower limit to the 16O/18O ratio of 400 in the nuclear region, possibly indicating that the nuclear starburst is in an early evolutionary stage, or that it is fed through a molecular inflow of, at most, solar metallicity.},

@article{GA2014,
	Abstract = {We report on the Herschel/PACS observations of OH in Mrk 231, with detections in nine doublets observed within the PACS range, and present radiative-transfer models for the outflowing OH. Clear signatures of outflowing gas are found in up to six OH doublets with different excitation requirements. At least two outflowing components are identified, one with OH radiatively excited, and the other with low excitation, presumably spatially extended and roughly spherical. Particularly prominent, the blue wing of the absorption detected in the in-ladder 2Π3/2J= 9/2 - 7/2 OH doublet at 65 μm, with Elower = 290 K, indicates that the excited outflowing gas is generated in a compact and warm (circum)nuclear region. Because the excited, outflowing OH gas in Mrk 231 is associated with the warm, far-infrared continuum source, it is most likely more compact (diameter of ~200-300 pc) than that probed by CO and HCN. Nevertheless, its mass-outflow rate per unit of solid angle as inferred from OH is similar to that previously derived from CO, ≳70 × (2.5 × 10-6/XOH) M⊙ yr-1 sr-1, where XOH is the OH abundance relative to H nuclei. In spherical symmetry, this would correspond to ≳850 × (2.5 × 10-6/XOH) M⊙ yr-1, though significant collimation is inferred from the line profiles. The momentum flux of the excited component attains ~15 LAGN/c, with an OH column density of (1.5-3) × 1017 cm-2 and a mechanical luminosity of ~1011L⊙. In addition, the detection of very excited, radiatively pumped OH peaking at central velocities indicates the presence of a nuclear reservoir of gas rich in OH, plausibly the 130 pc scale circumnuclear torus previously detected in OH megamaser emission, that may be feeding the outflow. An exceptional 18OH enhancement, with OH/18OH ≲ 30 at both central and blueshifted velocities, is most likely the result of interstellar-medium processing by recent starburst and supernova activity within the circumnuclear torus or thick disk.

	Abstract = {It is pointed out that isotope fractionation as a result of chemical reactions is due to the small zero-point energy differences between reactants and products of isotopically distinct species. Only at temperatures near absolute zero does this energy difference become significant. Favorable conditions for isotope fractionation on the considered basis exist in space within dense interstellar clouds. Temperatures of approximately 10 K may occur in these clouds. Under such conditions, ion-molecule reactions have the potential to distribute isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen unequally among the interstellar molecules. The present investigation makes use of a detailed model of the time-dependent chemistry of dense interstellar clouds to study cosmological isotope fractionation. Attention is given to fractionation chemistry and the calculation of rate parameters, the isotope fractionation results, and a comparison of theoretical results with observational data.},

	Abstract = {We present new observations of the nuclear star cluster in the central parsec of the Galaxy with the adaptive optics assisted, integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the ESO/VLT. Our work allows the spectroscopic detection of early- and late-type stars to mK >= 16, more than 2 mag deeper than our previous data sets. Our observations result in a total sample of 177 bona fide early-type stars. We find that most of these Wolf Rayet (WR), O-, and B-stars reside in two strongly warped disks between 0farcs8 and 12'' from Sgr A*, as well as a central compact concentration (the S-star cluster) centered on Sgr A*. The later type B-stars (mK >15) in the radial interval between 0farcs8 and 12'' seem to be in a more isotropic distribution outside the disks. The observed dearth of late-type stars in the central few arcseconds is puzzling, even when allowing for stellar collisions. The stellar mass function of the disk stars is extremely top heavy with a best-fit power law of dN/dm vprop m -0.45$\pm$ 0.3. WR/O-stars were formed in situ in a single star formation event ~6 Myr ago, this mass function probably reflects the initial mass function (IMF). The mass functions of the S-stars inside 0farcs8 and of the early-type stars at distances beyond 12'' are compatible with a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF (best-fit power law of dN/dm vprop m -2.15$\pm$ 0.3).

	Abstract = {We derive the first luminosity-metallicity (L-Z) relation for a large objectively selected sample of local galaxy pairs, and we compare the L-Z relation of the pairs with the relation for the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey. Galaxy pair members with small projected separations (s<20 kpc h-1) have systematically lower metallicities (~0.2 dex on average) than either the field galaxies or more widely separated pairs at the same luminosity. There is a strong correlation between metallicity and central burst strength in the galaxy pairs. All five galaxies in the pairs sample with strong central bursts have close companions and metallicities lower than the comparable field galaxies. Our results provide strong observational evidence for a merger scenario in which galaxy interactions cause gas flows toward the central regions, carrying less enriched gas from the outskirts of the galaxy into the central regions. The less enriched gas dilutes the preexisting nuclear gas to produce a lower metallicity than would be obtained prior to the interaction. These gas flows trigger central bursts of star formation, causing strong central burst strengths and possibly aiding the formation of blue bulges. We show that the timescale and central gas dilution required by this scenario are consistent with predictions from hydrodynamic merger models.},

The galaxy pairs are selected from the Main Galaxy Sample using stringent and well-understood criteria for redshift, spectral quality, available stellar masses, and metallicities. In agreement with previous studies, we find an enhancement in the star-formation rate (SFR) of galaxy pairs at projected separations <30-40 h-1 70 kpc. In addition, we find that this enhancement is highest (and extends to the greatest separations) for galaxies of approximately equal mass, the so-called major pairs. However, SFR enhancement can still be detected for a sample of galaxy pairs whose masses are within a factor of 10 of each other. Based on these results, we define a sample of close pairs (Δv <500 km s-1, rp < 30 h-1 70 kpc, and 0.1 < M 1/M 2 < 10) which we use to investigate interaction-induced effects in the luminosity-metallicity (LZ) relation. In agreement with the one previous study of the LZ relation in paired galaxies, we find an offset to lower metallicities (by ~0.1 dex) for a given luminosity for galaxies in pairs compared to the control sample. We also present the first mass-metallicity (MZ) relation comparison between paired galaxies and the field and again find an offset to lower metallicities (by ~0.05 dex) for a given mass. The smaller offset in the MZ relation indicates that both higher luminosities and lower metallicities may contribute to the shift of pairs relative to the control in the LZ relation. We show that the offset in the LZ relation depends on galaxy half-light radius, rh . Galaxies with rh lsim 3 h-1 70 kpc and with a close companion show a 0.05-0.1 dex downward offset in metallicity compared to control galaxies of the same size. Larger galaxies do not show this offset and have LZ and MZ relations consistent with the control sample. We investigate the physical impetus behind this empirical dependence on rh and consider the galaxy's dynamical time and bulge fractions as possible causes. We conclude that the former is unlikely to be a fundamental driver of the offset in the LZ relation for paired galaxies, but that bulge fraction may play a role. Finally, we study the active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction in both the pair and control sample and find that whilst selecting galaxies in different cuts of color and asymmetry yields different AGN fractions, the fraction for pairs and the control sample are consistent for a given set of selection criteria. This indicates that if AGNs are ignited as a result of interactions, this activity begins later than the close pairs stage (i.e. once the merger is complete).},

	Abstract = {We present spectra of the extended 12CO and 13CO J=1-->0 emission along the major axes of 17 nearby galaxies. Spatial variations in the ratio of CO and 13CO integrated intensities, R, are found in nearly every galaxy observed. There is an overall variation in R of 20%-40% from the inner 2 kpc to the disk. Roughly one-third of the survey galaxies have such gradients in R detected above the 2 σ confidence level. Though some galaxies show a lower central value of R, on average R inside 2 kpc is 10%-30% higher than R outside of 2 kpc. The average CO/13CO intensity ratio within the central 2 kpc of the survey sources is 11.6+/-0.4 (based on the noise)+/-1.5 (based on systematic uncertainties estimated from daily variations in CO and 13CO intensities). The 1 σ dispersion in R between galactic nuclei of 4.2 is also quite large. The average value of R outside 2 kpc is 9.8+/-0.6+/-1.2 with a standard deviation of 4.5. An increase in the CO/13CO intensity ratio from disk to nucleus may imply that the conversion factor between CO intensity and H2 column density, X, is lower in galactic nuclei. In addition, variations in physical conditions, most notably the gas kinetic temperature, affect both R and X. Abundance variations probably do not cause the gradient in R, though we do not rule out a decrease in effective cloud column densities in galactic nuclei possibly caused by destructive starburst superwinds. A modest rise in temperature (less than a factor of 2 or 3) from outside a 2 kpc radius toward the nucleus can easily account for the observed gradient. These results support previous work implying that X is lower in the center of the Milky Way and probably most galactic nuclei. Therefore, calculating H2 masses using the standard Galactic X-factor, especially within the central few kiloparsecs of galaxies, overestimates the true mass by factors of a few. The standard X-factor still appears to be appropriate for galactic disks.},

	Abstract = {Context: The determination of interstellar abundances is essential for a better understanding of stellar nucleosynthesis and the ``chemical'' evolution of the Galaxy. 
Aims: The aim is to determine 18O/17O abundance ratios across the entire Galaxy. These provide a measure of the amount of enrichment by high-mass versus intermediate-mass stars. 
Methods: Such ratios, derived from the C18O and C17O J = 1-0 lines alone, may be affected by systematic errors. Therefore, the C18O and C17O (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2), as well as the 13CO(1-0) and (2-1) lines, were observed towards 18 prominent galactic targets (a total of 25 positions). The combined dataset was analysed with a large velocity gradient model, accounting for optical depth effects. 
Results: The data cover galactocentric radii between 0.1 and 16.9 kpc (solar circle at 8.5 kpc). Near the centre of the Galaxy, 18O/17O = 2.88 $\pm$ 0.11. For the galactic disc out to a galactocentric distance of ~10 kpc, 18O/17O = 4.16 $\pm$ 0.09. At ~16.5 kpc from the galactic centre, 18O/17O = 5.03 $\pm$ 0.46. Assuming that 18O is synthesised predominantly in high-mass stars (M >8 M⊙), while C17O is mainly a product of lower mass stars, the ratio from the inner Galaxy indicates a dominance of CNO-hydrogen burning products that is also apparent in the carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. The high 18O/17O value of the solar system (5.5) relative to that of the ambient interstellar medium suggests contamination by nearby high-mass stars during its formation. The outer Galaxy poses a fundamental problem. High values in the metal-poor environment of the outer Galaxy are not matched by the low values observed towards the even more metal-poor Large Magellanic Cloud. Apparently, the outer Galaxy cannot be considered as an intermediate environment between the solar neighbourhood and the interstellar medium of small metal-poor galaxies. The apparent 18O/17O gradient along the galactic disc and the discrepancy between outer disc and LMC isotope ratios may be explained by different ages of the respective stellar populations. More data from the central and far outer parts of the Galaxy are, however, needed to improve the statistical significance of our results.},

	Abstract = {Nuclear inflows of metal-poor interstellar gas triggered by galaxy interactions can account for the systematically lower central oxygen abundances observed in local interacting galaxies. Here, we investigate the metallicity evolution of a large set of simulations of colliding galaxies. Our models include cooling, star formation, feedback, and a new stochastic method for tracking the mass recycled back to the interstellar medium from stellar winds and supernovae. We study the influence of merger-induced inflows, enrichment, gas consumption, and galactic winds in determining the nuclear metallicity. The central metallicity is primarily a competition between the inflow of low-metallicity gas and enrichment from star formation. An average depression in the nuclear metallicity of ~0.07 is found for gas-poor disk-disk interactions. Gas-rich disk-disk interactions, on the other hand, typically have an enhancement in the central metallicity that is positively correlated with the gas content. The simulations fare reasonably well when compared to the observed mass-metallicity and separation-metallicity relationships, but further study is warranted.},

	Abstract = {We present X-ray data for a complete sample of 44 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), obtained with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. These are the X-ray observations of the high luminosity portion of the Great Observatory All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS), which includes the most luminous infrared selected galaxies, log (Lir/L⊙) ≥ 11.73, in the local universe, z ≤ 0.088. X-rays were detected from 43 out of 44 objects, and their arcsec-resolution images, spectra, and radial brightness distributions are presented. With a selection by hard X-ray colour and the 6.4 keV iron line, AGN are found in 37% of the objects, with higher luminosity sources more likely to contain an AGN. These AGN also tend to be found in late-stage mergers. The AGN fraction would increase to 48% if objects with [Ne v]λ14.3 μm detection are included. Double AGN are clearly detected only in NGC 6240 among 24 double/triple systems. Other AGN are found either in single nucleus objects or in one of the double nuclei at similar rates. Objects without conventional X-ray signatures of AGN appear to be hard X-ray quiet, relative to the X-ray to far-IR correlation for starburst galaxies, as discussed elsewhere. Most objects also show extended soft X-ray emission, which is likely related to an outflow from the nuclear region, with a metal abundance pattern suggesting enrichment by core collapse supernovae, as expected for a starburst.},

	Abstract = {Mass outflows driven by stars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a key element in many current models of galaxy evolution. They may produce the observed black-hole-galaxy mass relation and regulate and quench both star formation in the host galaxy and black hole accretion. However, observational evidence of such feedback processes through outflows of the bulk of the star-forming molecular gas is still scarce. Here we report the detection of massive molecular outflows, traced by the hydroxyl molecule (OH), in far-infrared spectra of ULIRGs obtained with Herschel-PACS as part of the SHINING key project. In some of these objects the (terminal) outflow velocities exceed 1000 km s-1, and their outflow rates (up to ~1200 M sun yr-1) are several times larger than their star formation rates. We compare the outflow signatures in different types of ULIRGs and in starburst galaxies to address the issue of the energy source (AGN or starburst) of these outflows. We report preliminary evidence that ULIRGs with a higher AGN luminosity (and higher AGN contribution to L IR) have higher terminal velocities and shorter gas depletion timescales. The outflows in the observed ULIRGs are able to expel the cold gas reservoirs from the centers of these objects within ~106-108 years.

	Abstract = {We report the results from a systematic search for molecular (OH 119 μm) outflows with Herschel/PACS in a sample of 43 nearby (z < 0.3) galaxy mergers, mostly ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and QSOs. We find that the character of the OH feature (strength of the absorption relative to the emission) correlates with that of the 9.7 μm silicate feature, a measure of obscuration in ULIRGs. Unambiguous evidence for molecular outflows, based on the detection of OH absorption profiles with median velocities more blueshifted than -50 km s-1, is seen in 26 (70%) of the 37 OH-detected targets, suggesting a wide-angle (~145$\,^{\circ}$) outflow geometry. Conversely, unambiguous evidence for molecular inflows, based on the detection of OH absorption profiles with median velocities more redshifted than +50 km s-1, is seen in only four objects, suggesting a planar or filamentary geometry for the inflowing gas. Terminal outflow velocities of ~-1000 km s-1 are measured in several objects, but median outflow velocities are typically ~-200 km s-1. While the outflow velocities show no statistically significant dependence on the star formation rate, they are distinctly more blueshifted among systems with large active galactic nucleus (AGN) fractions and luminosities [log (L AGN/L ⊙) >= 11.8 $\pm$ 0.3]. The quasars in these systems play a dominant role in driving the molecular outflows. However, the most AGN dominated systems, where OH is seen purely in emission, show relatively modest OH line widths, despite their large AGN luminosities, perhaps indicating that molecular outflows subside once the quasar has cleared a path through the obscuring material.},

	Abstract = {We report HCN J = 4 → 3, HCO+ J = 4 → 3, and CS J = 7 → 6 observations in 20 nearby star-forming galaxies with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment 12 m telescope. Combined with four HCN, three HCO+, and four CS detections from the literature, we probe the empirical link between the luminosity of molecular gas (L^{\prime }_gas) and that of infrared emission (L IR), up to the highest gas densities (~106 cm-3) that have been probed so far. For nearby galaxies with large radii, we measure the IR luminosity within the submillimeter beam size (14''-18'') to match the molecular emission. We find linear slopes for L^{\prime }_{CS\, J=7{--}6}-L IR and L^{\prime }_{HCN\, J=4{--}3}-L IR, and a slightly super-linear slope for L^{\prime }_{HCO^+\, J=4{--}3}-L IR. The correlation of L^{\prime }_{CS\, J=7{--}6}-L IR even extends over eight orders of luminosity magnitude down to Galactic dense cores, with a fit of log(L IR) =1.00($\pm$ 0.01) ×log(L^{\prime }_{CS\, J=7{--}6}) + 4.03($\pm$ 0.04). Such linear correlations appear to hold for all densities >104 cm-3, and indicate that star formation rate is not related to the free-fall timescale for dense molecular gas.},

	Abstract = {(Ultra) luminous infrared galaxies ((U)LIRGs) are objects characterized by their extreme infrared (8-1000 μm) luminosities (L LIRG > 1011 L ⊙ and L ULIRG > 1012 L ⊙). The Herschel Comprehensive ULIRG Emission Survey (PI: van der Werf) presents a representative flux-limited sample of 29 (U)LIRGs that spans the full luminosity range of these objects (1011 L ⊙ <= L IR <= 1013 L ⊙). With the Herschel Space Observatory, we observe [C II] 157 μm, [O I] 63 μm, and [O I] 145 μm line emission with Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer, CO J = 4-3 through J = 13-12, [C I] 370 μm, and [C I] 609 μm with SPIRE, and low-J CO transitions with ground-based telescopes. The CO ladders of the sample are separated into three classes based on their excitation level. In 13 of the galaxies, the [O I] 63 μm emission line is self absorbed. Comparing the CO excitation to the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite 60/100 μm ratio and to far infrared luminosity, we find that the CO excitation is more correlated to the far infrared colors. We present cooling budgets for the galaxies and find fine-structure line flux deficits in the [C II], [Si II], [O I], and [C I] lines in the objects with the highest far IR fluxes, but do not observe this for CO 4 <= J upp <= 13. In order to study the heating of the molecular gas, we present a combination of three diagnostic quantities to help determine the dominant heating source. Using the CO excitation, the CO J = 1-0 linewidth, and the active galactic nucleus (AGN) contribution, we conclude that galaxies with large CO linewidths always have high-excitation CO ladders, and often low AGN contributions, suggesting that mechanical heating is important.

	Abstract = {We present the Herschel SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (FTS) atlas for a complete flux-limited sample of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) as part of the HERschel Ultra Luminous InfraRed Galaxy Survey (HERUS). The data reduction is described in detail and was optimized for faint FTS sources ,with particular care being taken for the subtraction of the background, which dominates the continuum shape of the spectra. To improve the final spectra, special treatment in the data reduction has been given to any observation suffering from artifacts in the data caused by anomalous instrumental effects. Complete spectra are shown covering 200-671 μm, with photometry in the SPIRE bands at 250, 350, and 500 μm. The spectra include near complete CO ladders for over half of our sample, as well as fine structure lines from [C i] 370 μm, [C i] 609 μm, and [N ii] 205 μm. We also detect H2O lines in several objects. We construct CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) for the sample, and compare their slopes with the far-infrared (FIR) colors and luminosities. We show that the CO SLEDs of ULIRGs can be broadly grouped into three classes based on their excitation. We find that the mid-J (5 < J < 8) lines are better correlated with the total FIR luminosity, suggesting that the warm gas component is closely linked to recent star formation. The higher J transitions do not linearly correlate with the FIR luminosity, consistent with them originating in hotter, denser gas that is unconnected to the current star formation. We conclude that in most cases more than one temperature component is required to model the CO SLEDs.},

	Abstract = {We present a Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), Chandra, and XMM-Newton survey of nine of the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). The unprecedented sensitivity of NuSTAR at energies above 10 keV enables spectral modeling with far better precision than was previously possible. Six of the nine sources observed were detected sufficiently well by NuSTAR to model in detail their broadband X-ray spectra, and recover the levels of obscuration and intrinsic X-ray luminosities. Only one source (IRAS 13120-5453) has a spectrum consistent with a Compton-thick active galactic nucleus (AGN), but we cannot rule out that a second source (Arp 220) harbors an extremely highly obscured AGN as well. Variability in column density (reduction by a factor of a few compared to older observations) is seen in IRAS 05189-2524 and Mrk 273, altering the classification of these borderline sources from Compton-thick to Compton-thin. The ULIRGs in our sample have surprisingly low observed fluxes in high-energy (>10 keV) X-rays, especially compared to their bolometric luminosities. They have lower ratios of unabsorbed 2-10 keV to bolometric luminosity, and unabsorbed 2-10 keV to mid-IR [O iv] line luminosity than do Seyfert 1 galaxies. We identify IRAS 08572+3915 as another candidate intrinsically X-ray weak source, similar to Mrk 231. We speculate that the X-ray weakness of IRAS 08572+3915 is related to its powerful outflow observed at other wavelengths.},

An H2 column density of aprox. 3 x 10 to the 21st power, a total mass of approx. 1 solar mass and characteristic temperature and density T approx. 750 K and approx. 2 x 10 to the 6th power per cu cm can be derived from the CO intensities. The density is too low by at least an order of magnitude for the observed infrared H2 and far infrared CO emission to be accounted for by a purely hydrodynamic shock, and support is lent to hydromagnetic shock models. From the present measurements, the relative abundance of CO is estimated to be CO H2 = 1.2 x .0001, corresponding to 20 percent of the cosmic abundance of C existing in the form of CO. The average relative abundance of OH in the shocked gas is O/H2 or = 5 x 10 to the -7th power.

The upper limit on the H3(+) abundance implies that the cosmic-ray ionization rate is of the order of 10 to the -16th/s or less. The H3(+) upper limit, together with a previous radio detection of H2D(+) emission, implies either an enormous overabundance of the deuterated molecule or else that most of the radio emission comes from clouds not located directly between use and the infrared source.

	Abstract = {Luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) dominate the star formation rate budget of the universe at zgtrsim 1, yet no local measurements of their heavy-element abundances exist. We measure nuclear or near-nuclear oxygen abundances in a sample of 100 star-forming LIRGs and ULIRGs using new, previously published, and archival spectroscopy of strong emission lines (including [O II] λλ3726, 3729) in galaxies with redshifts langle zrangle ~ 0.1. When compared to local emission-line galaxies of similar luminosity and mass (using the near-infrared luminosity-metallicity and mass-metallicity relations), we find that LIRGs and ULIRGs are underabundant by a factor of 2 on average. As a corollary, LIRGs and ULIRGs also have smaller effective yields. We conclude that the observed underabundance results from the combination of a decrease of abundance with increasing radius in the progenitor galaxies and strong, interaction- or merger-induced gas inflow into the galaxy nucleus. This conclusion demonstrates that local abundance scaling relations are not universal, a fact that must be accounted for when interpreting abundances earlier in the universe's history, when merger-induced star formation was the dominant mode. We use our local sample to compare to high-redshift samples and assess abundance evolution in LIRGs and ULIRGs. We find that abundances in these systems increased by ~0.2 dex from z ~ 0.6 to z ~ 0.1. Evolution from z ~ 2 submillimeter galaxies to z ~ 0.1 ULIRGs also appears to be present, although uncertainty due to spectroscopic limitations is large.},

	Abstract = {We present results of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) NICMOS H-band imaging of 73 of the most luminous (i.e., log[L IR/L sun]>11.4) infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey. This data set combines multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic data from space-based (Spitzer, HST, GALEX, and Chandra) and ground-based telescopes. In this paper, we use high-resolution near-infrared data to recover nuclear structure that is obscured by dust at optical wavelengths and measure the evolution in this structure along the merger sequence. A large fraction of all galaxies in our sample possess double nuclei (~63%) or show evidence for triple nuclei (~6%). Half of these double nuclei are not visible in the HST B-band images due to dust obscuration. The majority of interacting LIRGs have remaining merger timescales of 0.3-1.3 Gyr, based on the projected nuclear separations and the mass ratio of nuclei. We find that the bulge luminosity surface density L Bulge/R 2 Bulge increases significantly along the merger sequence (primarily due to a decrease of the bulge radius), while the bulge luminosity shows a small increase toward late merger stages. No significant increase of the bulge S{\'e}rsic index is found. LIRGs that show no interaction features have on average a significantly larger bulge luminosity, suggesting that non-merging LIRGs have larger bulge masses than merging LIRGs. This may be related to the flux-limited nature of the sample and the fact that mergers can significantly boost the IR luminosity of otherwise low luminosity galaxies. We find that the projected nuclear separation is significantly smaller for ULIRGs (median value of 1.2 kpc) than for LIRGs (median value of 6.7 kpc), suggesting that the LIRG phase appears earlier in mergers than the ULIRG phase.},

	Abstract = {IRAS flux densities, redshifts, and infrared luminosities are reported for all sources identified in the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS), a complete flux-limited survey of all extragalactic objects with total 60 μm flux density greater than 5.24 Jy, covering the entire sky surveyed by IRAS at Galactic latitudes |b|>5$\,^{\circ}$. The RBGS includes 629 objects, with median and mean sample redshifts of 0.0082 and 0.0126, respectively, and a maximum redshift of 0.0876. The RBGS supersedes the previous two-part IRAS Bright Galaxy Samples (BGS1+BGS2), which were compiled before the final (Pass 3) calibration of the IRAS Level 1 Archive in 1990 May. The RBGS also makes use of more accurate and consistent automated methods to measure the flux of objects with extended emission. The RBGS contains 39 objects that were not present in the BGS1+BGS2, and 28 objects from the BGS1+BGS2 have been dropped from RBGS because their revised 60 μm flux densities are not greater than 5.24 Jy. Comparison of revised flux measurements for sources in both surveys shows that most flux differences are in the range ~5%-25%, although some faint sources at 12 and 25 μm differ by as much as a factor of 2. Basic properties of the RBGS sources are summarized, including estimated total infrared luminosities, as well as updates to cross identifications with sources from optical galaxy catalogs established using the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. In addition, an atlas of images from the Digitized Sky Survey with overlays of the IRAS position uncertainty ellipse and annotated scale bars is provided for ease in visualizing the optical morphology in context with the angular and metric size of each object. The revised bolometric infrared luminosity function, φ(Lir), for infrared-bright galaxies in the local universe remains best fit by a double power law, φ(L)~Lα, with α=-0.6(+/-0.1) and α=-2.2(+/-0.1) below and above the ``characteristic'' infrared luminosity L*ir~1010.5Lsolar, respectively. A companion paper provides IRAS High Resolution (HIRES) processing of over 100 RBGS sources where improved spatial resolution often provides better IRAS source positions or allows for deconvolution of close galaxy pairs.},

	Abstract = {Observations of various isotopic species of interstellar CO, CN, CS, HCN, HNC, and HCO^+^ indicate that ^12^C/^13^C~40-50, ^16^O/^18^O~150-200, and ^18^O/^17^O >= 8 in the active nuclear regions of nearby galaxies. In contrast to the strong spatial variations of most kinematical, physical, and chemical properties, the isotope ratios are more smoothly distributed, thus allowing detailed studies of global anomalies. Modelling the `chemical' evolution during a starburst, the oxygen isotope ratios can be understood in terms of an `overabundance' of ^18^O. This is explained if high mass stars (>8 M_sun_) convert large amounts (>5%) of ^14^N into ^18^O and if the burst initial mass function (IMF) is biased in favor of massive stars. Relative to ^18^O, only small amounts of ^17^O are produced in massive stars. Large ^18^O/^17^O and small ^16^O/^18^O ratios should be a common signature of the advanced stages of nuclear starbursts. The ejection of large amounts of ^18^O by high mass stars also explains the peculiar solar ^18^O/^17^O ratio, if the solar system was formed in an OB association. ^12^C/^13^C ratios are less affected by nuclear starbursts. Therefore, infall of disk gas is likely the main cause for a ^12^C/^13^C enhancement. The large I(^12^CO)/I(^13^CO) line intensity ratios (>20) observed in gas-rich mergers are explained (1) by the presence of a molecular `halo' with low ^13^CO intensities, (2) by pre-burst gas masses which are negligible relative to the infalling mass or (3) by infalling gas containing relatively unprocessed material not only from the inner but also from the outer parts of the disks. While the core-halo scenario does not require particularly large ^12^C/^13^C ratios, the other effects require ^12^C/^13^C > 40 in mergers. The Galactic center ^12^C/^13^C, ^16^O/^17^O, ^18^O/^17^O, and ^14^N/^15^N ratios all support a quiescent state in the recent past. Predictions are made on the spatial distribution of the carbon and oxygen isotope ratios within the burst phase and on the ratios to be expected in ultraluminous mergers and in `normal' spirals. For the Galactic disk, the existence of small interstellar clouds with enhanced ^18^O/^17^O ratios is postulated. In starbursts, silicon and sulfur isotope ratios are expected to be approximately solar. A qualitative explanation for the Galactic disk, center, and solar system ^14^N/^15^N ratios is given, implying that the corresponding ratio in nuclear starbursts may be low (< 200).},

	Abstract = {To investigate the effects of the UV radiation on the chemistry of nitrogenated molecules in molecular clouds, we have carried out an observational study of the photodissociation region (PDR) associated with the reflection nebula NGC 7023. We mapped a region of 3' × 3' over the PDR in millimeter transitions of 12CO, 13CO, C18O, HCO+, HCN, HNC and N2H+. Spectra of CS, CN and C2H and of the rarer isotopic species H13CO+, H13CN, and HN13C, were also obtained at selected positions. We find evidences of selective photodissociation in the estimated 13CO/C15O ratio. Furthermore, all molecular abundances, except those of CN and perhaps C2H, decrease towards the star, and significant gradients in the values of some molecular abundance ratios (the HNC/HCN ratio decreases by a factor of 5, the N2H+/HCO+ ratio decreases by a factor of 12, the CN/HCN ratio increases by a factor of 8 and the (CN+HCN+HNC)/NH3 ratio increases by a factor of 30 towards the star position) reveal the existence of important chemical changes in this direction.
Chemical equilibrium model calculations have been also carried out in order to interpret the observed behavior. Our results show that the variations found in molecular abundances cannot be explained by the kinetic temperature and/or the hydrogen density gradients measured in this region. The observed behavior is well explained by the influence of the stellar UV radiation on the chemistry of the molecular gas if the emission arises in a region at a visual extinction between 6 and 10 mag from the star. Molecular destruction in this region (Aυ ˜ 6 mag) is due mainly to reactions with H+, C, H, C+, O, and to electronic recombination. The CN/HCN ratio is suggested as a tracer of enhanced UV fields.},

	Abstract = {The cloud-scale density, velocity dispersion, and gravitational boundedness of the interstellar medium (ISM) vary within and among galaxies. In turbulent models, these properties play key roles in the ability of gas to form stars. New high-fidelity, high-resolution surveys offer the prospect to measure these quantities across galaxies. We present a simple approach to make such measurements and to test hypotheses that link small-scale gas structure to star formation and galactic environment. Our calculations capture the key physics of the Larson scaling relations, and we show good correspondence between our approach and a traditional ``cloud properties'' treatment. However, we argue that our method is preferable in many cases because of its simple, reproducible characterization of all emission. Using, low-J 12CO data from recent surveys, we characterize the molecular ISM at 60 pc resolution in the Antennae, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), M31, M33, M51, and M74. We report the distributions of surface density, velocity dispersion, and gravitational boundedness at 60 pc scales and show galaxy-to-galaxy and intragalaxy variations in each. The distribution of flux as a function of surface density appears roughly lognormal with a 1σ width of ∼0.3 dex, though the center of this distribution varies from galaxy to galaxy. The 60 pc resolution line width and molecular gas surface density correlate well, which is a fundamental behavior expected for virialized or free-falling gas. Varying the measurement scale for the LMC and M31, we show that the molecular ISM has higher surface densities, lower line widths, and more self-gravity at smaller scales.},

	Abstract = {
Aims: We investigate the molecular gas properties of a sample of 23 galaxies in order to find and test chemical signatures of galaxy evolution and to compare them to IR evolutionary tracers. 
Methods: Observation at 3 mm wavelengths were obtained with the EMIR broadband receiver, mounted on the IRAM 30 m telescope on Pico Veleta, Spain. We compare the emission of the main molecular species with existing models of chemical evolution by means of line intensity ratios diagrams and principal component analysis. 
Results: We detect molecular emission in 19 galaxies in two 8 GHz-wide bands centred at 88 and 112 GHz. The main detected molecules are CO, 13CO, HCN, HNC, HCO+, CN, and C2H. We also detect HC3N J = 10-9 in the galaxies IRAS 17208, IC 860, NGC 4418, NGC 7771, and NGC 1068. The only HC3N detections are in objects with HCO+/HCN < 1. Galaxies with the highest HC3N/HCN ratios have warm IRAS colours (60/100 μm > 0.8). The brightest HC3N emission is found in IC 860, where we also detect the molecule in its vibrationally excited state. We find low HNC/HCN line ratios (<0.5), that cannot be explained by existing PDR or XDR chemical models. The intensities of HCO+ and HNC appear anti-correlated. No correlation is found between the HNC/HCN line ratio and dust temperature. All HNC-bright objects are either luminous IR galaxies (LIRG) or Seyferts. Galaxies with bright polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) emission show low HNC/HCO+ ratios. The CO/13CO ratio is positively correlated with the dust temperature and is generally higher than in our galaxy. The emission of CN and C18O is correlated. 
Conclusions: Bright HC3N emission in HCO+-faint objects may imply that these are not dominated by X-ray chemistry. Thus the HCN/HCO+ line ratio is not, by itself, a reliable tracer of XDRs. Bright HC3N and faint HCO+ could be signatures of embedded star-formation, instead of AGN activity. Mechanical heating caused by supernova explosions may be responsible for the low HNC/HCN and high HCO+/HCN ratios in some starbursts. We cannot exclude, however, that the discussed trends are largely caused by optical depth effects or excitation. Chemical models alone cannot explain all properties of the observed molecular emission. Better constraints to the gas spacial distribution and excitation are needed to distinguish abundance and excitation effects.},

	Abstract = {We present 3-mm observations obtained with the Institut de Radioastronomie Millim{\'e}trique (IRAM) 30-m telescope for 10 nearby gas-rich active galaxies spanning three orders of magnitude in infrared luminosity. Emission lines of HCO+(1-0), HCN(1-0) and C2H(1-0) were simultaneously detected in most galaxies of our sample. We also tentatively detected the rare isotopic species H13CN, HC15N and H13CO+ in up to four galaxies (IC 694, NGC 3690, NGC 4258 and NGC 6240). Our estimation shows that the optical depth of HCN is low to moderate in these galaxies (τ˜ 1-5). After comparing the intensity ratios of different molecular emission lines (HCN/HCO+, C2H/HCN and C2H/HCO+) with the infrared luminosity (LIR), we find that in the infrared luminous sample of five composite (AGN+starburst) galaxies these ratios vary with LIR: the HCN/HCO+ ratio increases with LIR, which is consistent with previous studies, while there is a slight trend in the composite galaxies that both C2H/HCN and C2H/HCO+ ratios decrease with increasing LIR. Although our sample is limited, this trend may possibly imply a relation between the overall gas density and the infrared luminosity of galaxies. Based on observations carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope. IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany) and IGN (Spain).},

	Abstract = {We present further development and the first public release of our multimodal nested sampling algorithm, called MULTINEST. This Bayesian inference tool calculates the evidence, with an associated error estimate, and produces posterior samples from distributions that may contain multiple modes and pronounced (curving) degeneracies in high dimensions. The developments presented here lead to further substantial improvements in sampling efficiency and robustness, as compared to the original algorithm presented in Feroz & Hobson, which itself significantly outperformed existing Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques in a wide range of astrophysical inference problems. The accuracy and economy of the MULTINEST algorithm are demonstrated by application to two toy problems and to a cosmological inference problem focusing on the extension of the vanilla Λ cold dark matter model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation of state for dark energy. The MULTINEST software, which is fully parallelized using MPI and includes an interface to COSMOMC, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/multinest/. It will also be released as part of the SUPERBAYES package, for the analysis of supersymmetric theories of particle physics, at http://www.superbayes.org.},

We selected 243 galaxies at 9 μm and 255 galaxies at 18 μm from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopy region. These galaxies were then classified by their optical emission lines, such as the line width of Hα or by their emission line ratios of [O III]/Hβ and [N II]/Hα into five types: Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) (Type 1); Type 2 AGN (Type 2); low-ionization narrow emission line galaxies (LINER); galaxies with both star formation and narrow-line AGN activity (composite galaxies); and star-forming galaxies (SF). We found that (i) the number density ratio of Type 2 to Type 1 AGNs is 1.73 $\pm$ 0.36, which is larger than a result obtained from the optical LF and (ii) this ratio decreases with increasing 18 μ m luminosity.},

@article{Downes1993,
	Abstract = {Molecular line observations suggest the central few hundred parsecs of ultraluminous IR galaxies have high mean gas densities, of about 3000 to 10,000/cu cm, unlike the centers of normal galaxies and very different from the disks of spiral galaxies. The CO line emission may not trace an ensemble of gravitationally bound gas clouds but instead a medium bound by the total potential of the Galactic center (gas and stars). This means the CO luminosity no longer measures gas mass alone, as in normal galaxies, but instead the geometric mean of the gas mass and the dynamical mass. In practice, molecular gas dominates the dynamical masses of the centers of ultraluminous galaxies, which suggests gas masses estimated from CO luminosities are basically correct. We present a model in which the 100/micron radiation from ultraluminous galaxies is optically thick and the CO line flux is proportional to the 100-micron flux, with S(CO)Delta(V)/S(100 microns) = 2-4 km/s. Our measurements of CO flux from 35 ultraluminous galaxies support this model of optically thick dust at 100 microns, providing additional evidence that the dust mass is high and the gas mass is a large fraction of the dynamical mass. We derive a relation between the M(gas)/L-prime(CO) ratio and the luminosity distance that we apply to Arp 220.},

	Abstract = {A total of 19 fields in the nearby spiral galaxy M33 have been observed by millimeter-wave interferometer at about 30 pc resolution. A total of 38 individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) were detected. The velocity widths, diameters, peak brightness temperatures, and masses are very similar to those of Galactic GMCs. The virial and molecular masses for the clouds agree to within 10 percent, confirming for the first time that the Galactic value of the conversion factor alpha from CO flux to H2 column density is valid for an external galaxy. The mass distribution of the M33 clouds is in good agreement with the Galactic mass distribution, but shows a cutoff at masses greater than 400,000 solar. This can be explained in terms of a simple model where the rate of accretion of material by a cloud is balanced by the rate of dissociation of molecular gas by stars within the cloud.},

	Abstract = {The fractionation of C and O isotopes in reactions of C(+) and HCO(+) with CO is investigated in relation to the importance of isotope fractionation in interstellar molecular clouds. The SIFT technique was used to determine rates and enthalpies for the reactions (C-13)(+) + (C-12)O yields (C-12)(+) + (C-13)O, HCO(+) + (C-13)O yields H(C-13)O(+) + CO and HCO(+) + C(O-18) yields HC(O-18)(+) + CO at temperatures from 80 to 510 K. The rates of the forward reactions are found to exceed those of the backward reactions at the lowest temperatures, and estimates of the exoergicities from the ratio of the rate constants reveal that they are in agreement with the zero point energy differences between reactants and products. Extrapolation of the data to the temperatures of dark and dense interstellar clouds indicates that C-13 and O-18 isotope fractionation can account well for the observed enhancement of (C-13)O abundance and to some extent for that of H(C-13)O(+).},

	Abstract = {Laboratory measurements using the ion-cyclotron resonance technique yield a rate constant of 2 by 10 to the -10th power cu cm/sec at 300 K for the isotope exchange C-13(+) + (C-12)O yields C-12(+) + (C-13)O. According to the usual ideas about ion-molecule reactions, this rate constant should also be appropriate at temperatures not exceeding about 100 K. Then the observed C-13/C-12 ratio obtained from radio observation of interstellar molecules may be either larger or smaller than the actual value in the interstellar medium by factors of 2 or so. If the ratio is altered from the actual interstellar value, it will not be the same in all molecules, and CO will tend to have the highest value. The chief astronomical uncertainty for the occurrence of this isotope fractionation is the abundance of 'unobservable' molecules which can react rapidly with C(+): e.g., O2, H2O, CO2, and CH4. If their abundance is greater than about one-tenth that of CO, the isotope fractionation will be inhibited.},

	Abstract = {We upgraded the chemical network from the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry 2006 to include isotopes such as 13C and 18O. This includes all corresponding isotopologues, their chemical reactions and the properly scaled reaction rate coefficients. We study the fractionation behavior of astrochemically relevant species over a wide range of model parameters, relevant for modelling of photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). We separately analyze the fractionation of the local abundances, fractionation of the total column densities, and fractionation visible in the emission line ratios. We find that strong C+ fractionation is possible in cool C+ gas. Optical thickness as well as excitation effects produce intensity ratios between 40 and 400. The fractionation of CO in PDRs is significantly different from the diffuse interstellar medium. PDR model results never show a fractionation ratio of the CO column density larger than the elemental ratio. Isotope-selective photo-dissociation is always dominated by the isotope-selective chemistry in dense PDR gas. The fractionation of C, CH, CH+ and HCO+ is studied in detail, showing that the fractionation of C, CH and CH+ is dominated by the fractionation of their parental species. The light hydrides chemically derive from C+, and, consequently, their fractionation state is coupled to that of C+. The fractionation of C is a mixed case depending on whether formation from CO or HCO+ dominates. Ratios of the emission lines of [C ii], [C i], 13CO, and H13CO+ provide individual diagnostics to the fractionation status of C+, C, and CO.

@article{Gratier2013,
	Abstract = {Context. Complex (iso-)nitrile molecules, such as CH3CN and HC3N, are relatively easily detected in our Galaxy and in other galaxies. 
Aims: We aim at constraining their chemistry through observations of two positions in the Horsehead edge: the photo-dissociation region (PDR) and the dense, cold, and UV-shielded core just behind it. 
Methods: We systematically searched for lines of CH3CN, HC3N, C3N, and some of their isomers in our sensitive unbiased line survey at 3, 2, and 1 mm. We stacked the lines of C3N to improve the detectability of this species. We derived column densities and abundances through Bayesian analysis using a large velocity gradient radiative transfer model. 
Results: We report the first clear detection of CH3NC at millimeter wavelength. We detected 17 lines of CH3CN at the PDR and 6 at the dense core position, and we resolved its hyperfine structure for 3 lines. We detected 4 lines of HC3N, and C3N is clearly detected at the PDR position. We computed new electron collisional rate coefficients for CH3CN, andwe found that including electron excitation reduces the derived column density by 40% at the PDR position, where the electron density is 1-5 cm-3. While CH3CN is 30 times more abundant in the PDR (2.5 × 10-10) than in the dense core (8 × 10-12), HC3N has similar abundance at both positions (8 × 10-12). The isomeric ratio CH3NC/CH3CN is 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02. 
Conclusions: The significant amount of complex (iso-)nitrile molecule in the UV illuminated gas is puzzling as the photodissociation is expected to be efficient. This is all the more surprising in the case of CH3CN, which is 30 times more abundant in the PDR than in the dense core. In this case, pure gas phase chemistry cannot reproduce the amount of CH3CN observed in the UV-illuminated gas. We propose that CH3CN gas phase abundance is enhanced when ice mantles of grains are destroyed through photo-desorption or thermal-evaporation in PDRs, and through sputtering in shocks.

	Abstract = {We present the initial results of a 3-mm spectral-line survey towards 83 methanol maser-selected massive star-forming regions. Here, we report observations of the J=5-4 and 6-5 rotational transitions of methyl cyanide (CH3CN) and the J=1-0 transition of HCO+ and H13CO+.
CH3CN emission is detected in 58 sources (70per cent of our sample). We estimate the temperature and column density for 37 of these using the rotational diagram (RD) method. The temperatures we derive range from 28-166K, and are lower than previously reported temperatures, derived from higher J transitions. We find that CH3CN is brighter and more commonly detected towards ultracompact HII (UCHII) regions than towards isolated maser sources. Detection of CH3CN towards isolated maser sources strongly suggests that these objects are internally heated and that CH3CN is excited prior to the UCHII phase of massive star formation.

HCO+ is detected towards 82 sources (99per cent of our sample), many of which exhibit asymmetric line profiles compared to H13CO+. Skewed profiles are indicative of inward or outward motions, however, we find approximately equal numbers of red- and blue-skewed profiles among all classes. Column densities are derived from an analysis of the HCO+ and H13CO+ line profiles.

80 sources have mid-infrared (mid-IR) counterparts: 68 seen in emission and 12 seen in absorption as `dark clouds'. Seven of the 12 dark clouds exhibit asymmetric HCO+ profiles, six of which are skewed to the blue, indicating infalling motions. CH3CN is also common in dark clouds, where it has a 90per cent detection rate.},

	Abstract = {We have detected strong methyl cyanide (CH3CN) emission lines from the hot core regions W51e1 and W51e2, using the BIMA Array. This is the first survey of CH3CN toward W51 to utilize both 3 mm (J=5-4 and 6-5) and 1 mm (J=12-11, 13-12, and 14-13) transitions as probes of the physical and chemical conditions present in these regions. The emission reveals molecular clumps centered on the ultracompact H II regions found by Zhang and colleagues. The CH3CN lines show large optical depths in the lower K transitions toward both regions in W51. To determine the true kinetic temperatures, densities, and column densities of the emitting regions W51e1 and e2, statistical equilibrium models were used to calculate the relative populations of each energy level. The best fit to the observed spectra toward W51e1 is given by a temperature of 123(11) K, a hydrogen density of 5(1)×105 cm-3, and a total methyl cyanide column density of 1.4(1)×1016 cm-2. The uncertainties describe a nominal 90% confidence interval for the last digit given. The best fit to the observed spectra toward W51e2 is given by a temperature of 153(21) K, a hydrogen density of 5(2)×105 cm-3, and a total methyl cyanide column density of 3.8(7)×1016 cm-2. Our observations indicate that CH3CN can be used as a good probe of the physical conditions present in hot molecular cores and as a tracer of hard-to-detect large molecular species. Despite the differences in molecular structure and chemical formation mechanisms, methyl cyanide (CH3CN), ethyl cyanide (CH3CH2CN), and acetic acid (CH3COOH) are found to have similar abundances toward the W51e1 and e2 regions. In contrast, for a column density of CH3CN more than 15 times smaller than the column density of HCOOCH3 the integrated line flux is more than 7 times larger. Thus, because CH3CN lines are easy to detect, it appears to be a much better tracer of CH3CH2CN and CH3COOH than HCOOCH3.},

The HNCO/13CS abundance ratio is highly contrasted (up to a factor of 30) between the shielded molecular clouds mostly affected by shocks, where HNCO is released to gas phase from grain mantles, and those pervaded by an intense UV radiation field, where HNCO is photodissociated and CS production favored via ion reactions. We propose the relative HNCO to CS abundance ratio as a highly contrasted diagnostic tool to distinguish between the influence of shocks and/or the radiation field in the nuclear regions of galaxies and their relation to the evolutionary state of their nuclear star formation bursts.

	Abstract = {We surveyed 81 dense molecular cores associated with regions of massive star formation and Sgr A in the JK-1K-1 = 505-404 and 10010-909 lines of HNCO. Line emission was detected towards 57 objects. Selected subsamples were also observed in the 101-000, 404-303, 707-606, 15015-14014, 16016-15015 and 21021-20020 lines, covering a frequency range from 22 to 461 GHz. HNCO lines from the K-1 = 2,3 ladders were detected in several sources. Towards Orion-KL, K-1 = 5 transitions with upper state energies Eu/k ~ 1100 and 1300 K could be observed. Five HNCO cores were mapped. The sources remain spatially unresolved at 220 and 461 GHz (10010-909 and 21010-20020 transitions) with beam sizes of 24'' and 18\arcsec, respectively. The detection of hyperfine structure in the 101-000 transition is consistent with optically thin emission under conditions of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is corroborated by a rotational diagram analysis of Orion-KL that indicates optically thin line emission also for transitions between higher excited states. At the same time a tentative detection of interstellar HN13CO (the 100,10-90,9 line at 220 GHz toward G 310.12-0.20) suggests optically thick emission from some rotational transitions. Typical HNCO abundances relative to H2 as derived from a population diagram analysis are ~ 10-9. The rotational temperatures reach ~ 500 K. The gas densities in regions of HNCO K-1=0 emission should be n>~ 106 cm-3 and in regions of K-1>0 emission about an order of magnitude higher even for radiative excitation. HNCO abundances are found to be enhanced in high-velocity gas. HNCO integrated line intensities correlate well with those of thermal SiO emission. This indicates a spatial coexistence of the two species and may hint at a common production mechanism, presumably based on shock chemistry.

	Abstract = {Context. The increased sensitivity and high spectral resolution of millimeter telescopes allow the detection of an increasing number of isotopically substituted molecules in the interstellar medium. The 14N/15N ratio is difficult to measure directly for molecules containing carbon. 
Aims: Using a time-dependent gas-phase chemical model, we check the underlying hypothesis that the 13C/12C ratio of nitriles and isonitriles is equal to the elemental value. 
Methods: We built a chemical network that contains D, 13C, and 15N molecular species after a careful check of the possible fractionation reactions at work in the gas phase. 
Results: Model results obtained for two different physical conditions that correspond to a moderately dense cloud in an early evolutionary stage and a dense, depleted prestellar core tend to show that ammonia and its singly deuterated form are somewhat enriched in 15N, which agrees with observations. The 14N/15N ratio in N2H+ is found to be close to the elemental value, in contrast to previous models that obtain a significant enrichment, because we found that the fractionation reaction between 15N and N2H+ has a barrier in the entrance channel. The high values of the N2H+/15NNH+ and N2H+/N15NH+ ratios derived in L1544 cannot be reproduced in our model. Finally, we find that nitriles and isonitriles are in fact significantly depleted in 13C, thereby challenging previous interpretations of observed C15N, HC15N, and H15NC abundances from 13C containing isotopologues.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the spectral line energy distributions of 13CO and C18O for the J = 1→0 up to J = 7→6 transitions in the gravitationally lensed ultraluminous infrared galaxy SMM J2135-0102 at z = 2.3. This is the first detection of 13CO and C18O in a high-redshift star-forming galaxy. These data comprise observations of six transitions taken with Plateau de Bure Interferometer and we combine these with ˜33 GHz Jansky Very Large Array data and our previous spatially resolved 12CO and continuum emission information to better constrain the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) within this system. We study both the velocity-integrated and kinematically decomposed properties of the galaxy and coupled with a large velocity gradient (LVG) model we find that the star-forming regions in the system vary in their cold gas properties, in particular in their chemical abundance ratios. We find strong C18O emission both in the velocity-integrated emission and in the two kinematic components at the periphery of the system, where the C18O line flux is equivalent to or higher than the 13CO. We derive an average velocity-integrated flux ratio of 13CO/C18O ˜ 1 which suggests an abundance ratio of [13CO]/[C18O] which is at least seven times lower than that in the Milky Way. This is suggestive of enhanced C18O abundance, perhaps indicating star formation preferentially biased to high-mass stars. We estimate the relative contribution to the ISM heating from cosmic rays and UV of (30-3300) × 10-25 erg s-1 and 45 × 10-25 erg s-1 per H2 molecule respectively and find them to be comparable to the total cooling rate of (0.8-20) × 10-25 erg s-1 from the CO. However, our LVG models indicate high (>100 K) temperatures and densities (>103) cm-3 in the ISM which may suggest that cosmic rays play a more important role than UV heating in this system. If cosmic rays dominate the heating of the ISM, the increased temperature in the star-forming regions may favour the formation of massive stars and so explain the enhanced C18O abundance. This is a potentially important result for a system which may evolve into a local elliptical galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We show that the 12CO/13CO intensity ratio in nearby galaxies varies systematically as a function of the star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) and gas surface density. The same effect is observed in different transitions, and in the 12CO/C18O ratio, while the 13CO/C18O ratio appears to remain constant as a function of ΣSFR. We discuss the cause of these variations, considering both changes in the physical state of the gas and chemical changes that lead to abundance variations. We used the observed correlations with C18O to suggest that abundance variations are unlikely to be causing the systematic trend observed with ΣSFR, and thus that the mean gas temperature and/or velocity dispersion are systematically higher in higher SFR surface density regions. We present the best-fitting relations between ΣSFR and the 12CO/13CO and 12CO/C18O ratios, and discuss how this effect can help us predict CO isotope emission from galaxies across the known Universe.},

	Abstract = {We present observations of 13CO(1-0) in 17 Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy ATLAS3D early-type galaxies (ETGs), obtained simultaneously with 12CO(1-0) observations. The 13CO in six ETGs is sufficiently bright to create images. In these six sources, we do not detect any significant radial gradient in the 13CO/12CO ratio between the nucleus and the outlying molecular gas. Using the 12CO channel maps as 3D masks to stack the 13CO emission, we are able to detect 15/17 galaxies to >3σ (and 12/17 to at least 5σ) significance in a spatially integrated manner. Overall, ETGs show a wide distribution of 13CO/12CO ratios, but Virgo cluster and group galaxies preferentially show a 13CO/12CO ratio about two times larger than field galaxies, although this could also be due to a mass dependence, or the CO spatial extent (RCO/Re). ETGs whose gas has a morphologically settled appearance also show boosted 13CO/12CO ratios. We hypothesize that this variation could be caused by (i) the extra enrichment of gas from molecular reprocessing occurring in low-mass stars (boosting the abundance of 13C to 12C in the absence of external gas accretion), (ii) much higher pressure being exerted on the mid-plane gas (by the intracluster medium) in the cluster environment than in isolated galaxies, or (iii) all but the densest molecular gas clumps being stripped as the galaxies fall into the cluster. Further observations of 13CO in dense environments, particularly of spirals, as well as studies of other isotopologues, should be able to distinguish between these hypotheses.},

@article{Milam2005,
	Abstract = {New measurements of 12C/13C ratios in Galactic molecular clouds have been conducted using the N=1-->0 transition of the CN radical. This species is unique in that it has extensive hyperfine structure that can be accurately used to correct for line saturation effects. Combined with the past observations of Savage and coworkers, the ratios derived from CN are the most extensive data set to date for molecular clouds, and they include sources that lie in the range of 0.09-16.41 kpc in distance from the Galactic center (DGC). The ratios derived from CN indicate a gradient with Galactic distance of 12C/13C=6.01DGC+12.28. This gradient agrees rather closely with those derived from measurements of CO and H2CO. The least-squares fit to all data points for the three molecules is 12C/13C=6.21DGC+18.71. CO, CN, and H2CO are synthesized from quite varied reactions, and any 13C fractionation must follow different pathways for these three species. The relatively good agreement between the 12C/13C ratios of the three molecules, as well as their lack of correlation with gas kinetic temperature, suggests that chemical fractionation and isotope-selective photodissociation both do not play a substantial role in influencing such ratios. Therefore, the 12C/13C gradient found in the Galaxy is a true indicator of Galactic chemical evolution. The apparent discrepancy between the solar system (12C/13C=89) and local interstellar medium values (12C/13C~68) of this ratio may be a result of 13C enrichment since the formation of the solar system, as predicted by recent models.},

The 3-mm and 1-mm observations were performed with the Institut de Radioastronomie Millim{\'e}trique 30-m telescope and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment 12-m telescope, respectively. We detected H13CN and HN13C in 1-0 and 3-2, and HC15N 1-0, among which HC15N 1-0 and HN13C 1-0 are detected in Arp 220 for the first time. The H13CO+ 1-0 and 3-2 lines are unlikely to be detected because of the confusion of SiO lines. We find that the ratio of the line brightness temperatures of HN13C 3-2/1-0 is 2.4, which is significantly higher than that of H13CN 3-2/1-0 (0.73). This indicates that HN13C and HNC molecules are in denser regions than H13CN and HCN molecules. With the line ratio of H13CN 1-0 and HC15N 1-0, the 14N/15N ratio was estimated to be 440^{+140}_{-82}, which is larger than that of the local interstellar medium.},

	Abstract = {Millimeter interferometer observations of the infrared luminous galaxies NGC 828 and NGC 6240 at about 7 arcsec resolution are reported which reveal details of the spatial distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in these two high-luminosity IRAS galaxies. The centers of both galaxies have massive concentrations of molecular gas representing a large fraction of the total dynamical mass. These regions are likely to be extremely unstable to gravitational instability. The high infrared luminosity of these galaxies is probably triggered by the galactic interaction. However, the estimated available kinetic energy in the ISM indicates that the luminosity can be provided by the bulk kinetic energy release for no more than 10 to the 6th yr, far too short compared to the time scale for merging. In both galaxies, the CO data support the general picture that these are merger systems.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained H- and K-band spectra simultaneously in the central region of the merging galaxy system NGC 6240. From the observed line flux ratios of molecular hydrogen (H2) emission, including sensitive upper limits on highly excited H2 lines, we conclude that the emission is excited purely by thermal mechanisms. Previously suggested contributions of UV fluorescence are negligible, at least in the central region. The H2 lines are most likely excited by shocks, nondissociative or partially dissociative ones, although we cannot rule out completely X-ray heating. The H2 lines are emitted between the double nuclei. From its excitation mechanism and its peak position, we conclude that the emission is from a global shock caused by a galaxy-galaxy collision. The comparison between the timescale of the H2 emission and the dynamical timescale of the double nuclei suggests that the galaxy-galaxy merging is in a very early phase, such as would be the case for the first close encounter.},

	Abstract = {We report ALMA Band 7 (350 GHz) imaging at 0.''4-0.''6 resolution and Band 9 (696 GHz) at ~0.''25 resolution of the luminous IR galaxies Arp 220 and NGC 6240. The long wavelength dust continuum is used to estimate interstellar medium masses for Arp 220 east and west and NGC 6240 of 1.9, 4.2, and 1.6 × 109 M ⊙within radii of 69, 65, and 190 pc. The HCN emission was modeled to derive the emissivity distribution as a function of radius and the kinematics of each nuclear disk, yielding dynamical masses consistent with the masses and sizes derived from the dust emission. In Arp 220, the major dust and gas concentrations are at radii less than 50 pc in both counter-rotating nuclear disks. The thickness of the disks in Arp 220 estimated from the velocity dispersion and rotation velocities are 10-20 pc and the mean gas densities are nH_2 ˜ 10^5 cm-3 at R <50 pc. We develop an analytic treatment for the molecular excitation (including photon trapping), yielding volume densities for both the HCN and CS emission with n H2 ~ 2 × 105 cm-3. The agreement of the mean density from the total mass and size with that required for excitation suggests that the volume is essentially filled with dense gas, i.e., it is not cloudy or like swiss cheese.},

	Abstract = {Observations have revealed prodigious amounts of star formation in starburst galaxies as traced by dust and molecular emission, even at large redshifts. Recent work shows that for both nearby spiral galaxies and distant starbursts, the global star formation rate, as indicated by the infrared luminosity, has a tight and almost linear correlation with the amount of dense gas as traced by the luminosity of HCN. Our surveys of Galactic dense cores in HCN 1-0 emission show that this correlation continues to a much smaller scale, with nearly the same ratio of infrared luminosity to HCN luminosity found over 7-8 orders of magnitude in LIR, with a lower cutoff around 104.5 Lsolar of infrared luminosity. The linear correlation suggests that we may understand distant star formation in terms of the known properties of local star-forming regions. Both the correlation and the luminosity cutoff can be explained if the basic unit of star formation in galaxies is a dense core, similar to those studied in our Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We report the results from a comprehensive study of 74 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and 34 Palomar-Green (PG) quasars within z ~ 0.3 observed with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). The contribution of nuclear activity to the bolometric luminosity in these systems is quantified using six independent methods that span a range in wavelength and give consistent results within ~$\pm$10%-15% on average. This agreement suggests that deeply buried active galactic nuclei (AGNs) invisible to Spitzer IRS but bright in the far-infrared are not common in this sample. The average derived AGN contribution in ULIRGs is ~35%-40%, ranging from ~15%-35% among "cool" (f 25/f 60 <= 0.2) optically classified H II-like and LINER ULIRGs to ~50 and ~75% among warm Seyfert 2 and Seyfert 1 ULIRGs, respectively. This number exceeds ~80% in PG QSOs. ULIRGs fall in one of three distinct AGN classes: (1) objects with small extinctions and large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) equivalent widths are highly starburst-dominated; (2) systems with large extinctions and modest PAH equivalent widths have larger AGN contributions, but still tend to be starburst-dominated; and (3) ULIRGs with both small extinctions and small PAH equivalent widths host AGN that are at least as powerful as the starbursts. The AGN contributions in class 2 ULIRGs are more uncertain than in the other objects, and we cannot formally rule out the possibility that these objects represent a physically distinct type of ULIRGs. A morphological trend is seen along the sequence (1)-(2)-(3), in general agreement with the standard ULIRG-QSO evolution scenario and suggestive of a broad peak in extinction during the intermediate stages of merger evolution. However, the scatter in this sequence, including the presence of a significant number of AGN-dominated systems prior to coalescence and starburst-dominated but fully merged systems, implies that black hole accretion, in addition to depending on the merger phase, also has a strong chaotic/random component, as in local AGNs.},

	Abstract = {Luminous (LIRGs; log (L IR/L ⊙) = 11.00-11.99) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs; log (L IR/L ⊙) = 12.00-12.99) are the most extreme star-forming galaxies in the universe. The local (U)LIRGs provide a unique opportunity to study their multi-wavelength properties in detail for comparison with their more numerous counterparts at high redshifts. We present common large aperture photometry at radio through X-ray wavelengths and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a sample of 53 nearby (z < 0.083) LIRGs and 11 ULIRGs spanning log (L IR/L ⊙) = 11.14-12.57 from the flux-limited (f 60 μm > 5.24 Jy) Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey. The SEDs for all objects are similar in that they show a broad, thermal stellar peak (~0.3-2 μm), and a dominant FIR (~40-200 μm) thermal dust peak, where νL ν(60 μm)/νL ν(V) increases from ~2 to 30 with increasing L IR. When normalized at IRAS 60 μm, the largest range in the luminosity ratio, R(λ) ≡ log[νL ν(λ)/νL ν(60 μm)], observed over the full sample is seen in the hard X-rays (HX = 2-10 keV), where ΔR HX = 3.73 (\bar{R}_{HX} = -3.10). A small range is found in the radio (1.4 GHz), ΔR 1.4 GHz = 1.75, where the mean ratio is largest, (\bar{R}_1.4\,GHz = -5.81). Total infrared luminosities, L IR(8-1000 μm), dust temperatures, and dust masses were computed from fitting thermal dust emission modified blackbodies to the mid-infrared (MIR) through submillimeter SEDs. The new results reflect an overall ~0.02 dex lower luminosity than the original IRAS values. Total stellar masses were computed by fitting stellar population synthesis models to the observed near-infrared (NIR) through ultraviolet (UV) SEDs. Mean stellar masses are found to be log (M sstarf/M ⊙) = 10.79 $\pm$ 0.40. Star formation rates have been determined from the infrared (SFRIR ~ 45 M ⊙ yr-1) and from the monochromatic UV luminosities (SFRUV ~ 1.3 M ⊙ yr-1), respectively. Multi-wavelength active galactic nucleus (AGN) indicators have be used to select putative AGNs: About 60% of the ULIRGs would have been classified as an AGN by at least one of the selection criteria.},

	Abstract = {It is known that merging galaxies with luminous starbursts and high far-infrared luminosities tend to have higher R1-0=12CO (J=1-0)/13CO (J=1-0) integrated line intensity ratios (R1-0~=20-50) than normal spiral galaxies (R1-0~=5-15). Comparing far-infrared luminosities [L(FIR)] with those of 12CO (J=1-0) and 13CO (J=1-0) for a sample of normal and starburst galaxies, Taniguchi & Ohyama found that the observed high R1-0 values for the luminous starburst mergers are attributed to their lower (by a factor of 3 on average) 13CO line intensities. They suggested the following two possibilities: in the luminous starburst mergers (1) 13CO is underabundant with respect to 12CO, or (2) exitation and/or optical depth effects are responsible for the change in R1-0. In this paper, we investigate the second possibility, using higher transition data of both 12CO and 13CO emission lines. Applying the same method proposed by Taniguchi & Ohyama to both 12CO (J=2-1) and 13CO (J=2-1), we find that 13CO (J=2-1) is also depressed with respect to 12CO (J=2-1). This suggests that the 13CO gas may be underabundant in the high-R1-0 starburst mergers, although we cannot rule out the possibility that excitation and optical depth effects are still affecting R2-1, for example, as a result of the large velocity widths in the CO emission lines. Additional observations of both 12CO and 13CO lines at J>=3 are required to better constrain the conditions of the molecular gas in luminous starburst galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present new Institut de Radioastronomie Millim{\'e}trique (IRAM) 30 m spectroscopic observations of the ˜88 GHz band, including emission from the {CCH}(N=1\to 0) multiplet, HCN (J=1\to 0), {{HCO}}+(J=1\to 0), and {HNC}(J=1\to 0), for a sample of 58 local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). By combining our new IRAM data with literature data and Spitzer/IRS spectroscopy, we study the correspondence between these putative tracers of dense gas and the relative contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star formation to the mid-infrared luminosity of each system. We find the HCN (1-0) emission to be enhanced in AGN-dominated systems (< {L}{HCN(1-0)}\prime /{L}{{HCO}+(1-0)}\prime > =1.84), compared to composite and starburst-dominated systems (< {L}{HCN(1-0)}\prime /{L}{{HCO}+(1-0)}\prime > =1.14, and 0.88, respectively). However, some composite and starburst systems have {L}{HCN(1-0)}\prime /{L}{{HCO}+(1-0)}\prime ratios comparable to those of AGNs, indicating that enhanced HCN emission is not uniquely associated with energetically dominant AGNs. After removing AGN-dominated systems from the sample, we find a linear relationship (within the uncertainties) between log10({L}{HCN(1-0)}\prime ) and log10(LIR), consistent with most previous findings. {L}{HCN(1-0)}\prime /LIR, typically interpreted as the dense-gas depletion time, appears to have no systematic trend with LIR for our sample of luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies, and has significant scatter. The galaxy-integrated {L}{HCN(1-0)}\prime and {L}{{HCO}+(1-0)}\prime emission do not appear to have a simple interpretation in terms of the AGN dominance or the star formation rate, and are likely determined by multiple processes, including density and radiative effects.

	Abstract = {A comparison of the (C-12)O and (C-13)O emissions of six systems of merging galaxies - NGC 828, NGC 3256, Arp 220, NGC 4194, Arp 299, and NGC 6240 - is presented. The observations were made in both the J = 1-0 and J = 2-1 transitions with the IRAM 30-m and SEST 15-m telescopes. The ((C-12)O data on NGC 828 and NGC 4194 are presented. In all galaxies but NGC 828, the (C-13)O emission is much weaker than in spirals. The average values of the emissivity ratios observed at the few-kiloparsec scale are 30 and 40 in the (1-0) and (2-1) transitions, respectively. These values are significantly larger than those usually observed in normal spiral galaxies, which are always between 5 and 15 for the J = 1-0 line. It is shown that this peculiar behavior cannot be interpreted as being due to the dominant presence of diffuse gas, and it cannot be attributed to optically thin CO emission either. The faint (C-13)O lines in mergers are thus likely due either to an underabundance of (C-13)O or to an overabundance of (C-12)O.},

	Abstract = {Chemical fractionation of the various isotopes of carbon monoxide has been studied in four isolated dark clouds. At positions away from the centers of three of the objects - B5, B335, and L1262 - the abundance of (CO-13) relative to C(O-18) is at least a factor of 4 greater than at the central positions. This detection of carbon isotope fractionation is consistent with theoretical predictions of (CO-13) enhancement in the outer parts of cool clouds. Combined observations of the J = 2 to 1 and J = 1 to 0 transitions of several CO isotopes have enabled us to derive molecular hydrogen densities and to assess the effect of saturation and resonant scattering. Abundance ratios of the rarer isotopic species in the cloud centers have also been determined.},

	Abstract = {The chemistry in the central regions of galaxies is expected to be strongly influenced by their nuclear activity. To find the best tracers of nuclear activity is of key importance to understand the processes taking place in the most obscured regions of galactic nuclei. In this work, we present multiline observations of CS, C34S, HNCO, and C18O in a sample of 11 bright galaxies prototypical for different types of activity. The 32S/34S isotopic ratio is ~10, supporting the idea of an isotopical 34S enrichment due to massive star formation in the nuclear regions of galaxies. Although C32S and C34S do not seem to be significantly affected by the activity type, the HNCO abundance appears highly contrasted among starbursts (SBs). We observed HNCO abundance variations of nearly 2 orders of magnitude. The HNCO molecule is shown to be a good tracer of the amount of molecular material fueling the SB and therefore can be used as a diagnostics of the evolutionary state of a nuclear SB.},

	Abstract = {We present new optical observations of young massive star clusters in Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy, taken in UBVI with the Hubble Space Telescope ACS HRC camera. We find a total of 206 probable clusters whose spatial distribution is centrally concentrated toward the nucleus of Arp 220. We use model star cluster tracks to determine ages, luminosities, and masses for 14 clusters with complete UBVI indices or previously published near-infrared data. We estimate rough masses for 24 additional clusters with I<24 mag from BVI indices alone. The clusters with useful ages fall into two distinct groups: a ``young'' population (<10 Myr) and an intermediate-age population (~=300 Myr). There are many clusters with masses clearly above 106 Msolar and possibly even above 107 Msolar in the most extreme instances. These masses are high enough that the clusters being formed in the Arp 220 starburst can be considered to be genuine young globular clusters. In addition, this study allows us to extend the observed correlation between global star formation rate and maximum cluster luminosity by more than 1 order of magnitude in star formation rate.},

Narrowband imaging using Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 has resolved the previously observed peak in Hα+[N ii] emission into a bubble-shaped feature. This feature measures 1.″6 in diameter, or 600 pc, and is only 1″ northwest of the western nucleus. The bubble is aligned with the western nucleus and the large-scale outflow axis seen in X-rays. We explore several possibilities for the bubble origin, including a jet or outflow from a hidden active galactic nucleus (AGN), outflows from high levels of star formation within the few hundred pc nuclear gas disk, or an ultraluminous X-ray source. An obscured AGN or high levels of star formation within the inner ∼100 pc of the nuclei are favored based on the alignment of the bubble and energetics arguments.},

	Abstract = {We present new, high angular resolution (~0.22") MERLIN observations of neutral hydrogen (H I) absorption and λ21 cm radio continuum emission across the central ~900 pc of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy Arp 220. Spatially resolved H I absorption is detected against the morphologically complex and extended λ21 cm radio continuum emission, consistent with two counterrotating disks of neutral hydrogen, with a small bridge of gas connecting the two. Column densities across the two nuclei are high, lying in the range 8×1019Ts(K)<~NH<~2.4×1020Ts(K) cm-2 (Ts is spin temperature) and corresponding to optical extinctions of 0.052Ts(K)<~AV<~0.155Ts(K) mag, with the higher column densities in the eastern nucleus. Velocity gradients are clearly visible across each nucleus, reaching 1010+/-20 km s-1 kpc-1 in P.A.~55deg and 830+/-20 km s-1 kpc-1 in P.A.~270deg for eastern and western nuclei, respectively. These gradients imply dynamical masses MD=1.1×109(sin-2i) (E) and 1.7×108(sin-2i) Msolar (W), assuming that the neutral gas is distributed in two thin circularly rotating disks. We propose a merger model in which the two nuclei represent the galaxy cores that have survived the initial encounter and are now in the final stages of merging, similar to conclusions drawn from previous CO studies. However, we suggest that instead of being coplanar with the main CO disk (in which the eastern nucleus is embedded), the western nucleus lies above it and, as suggested by the bridge of H I connecting the two nuclei, will soon complete its final merger with the main disk. We suggest that the collection of radio supernovae (RSNe) detected in VLBA studies in the more compact western nucleus represents the second burst of star formation associated with this final merger stage and that free-free absorption due to ionized gas in the bulgelike component can account for the observed RSN distribution.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the relation between infrared luminosity and molecular line luminosity, for a variety of molecular transitions, using a sample of 34 nearby galaxies spanning a broad range of infrared luminosities (1010 L sun < L IR < 1012.5 L sun). We show that the power-law index of the relation is sensitive to the critical density of the molecular gas tracer used, and that the dominant driver in observed molecular line ratios in galaxies is the gas density. As most nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) exhibit strong signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in their center, we revisit previous claims questioning the reliability of HCN as a probe of the dense gas responsible for star formation in the presence of AGNs. We find that the enhanced HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) luminosity ratio observed in ULIRGs can be successfully reproduced using numerical models with fixed chemical abundances and without AGN-induced chemistry effects. We extend this analysis to a total of 10 molecular line ratios by combining the following transitions: CO(1-0), HCO+(1-0), HCO+(3-2), HCN(1-0), and HCN(3-2). Our results suggest that AGNs reside in systems with higher dense gas fraction, and that chemistry or other effects associated with their hard radiation field may not dominate (NGC 1068 is one exception). Galaxy merger could be the underlying cause of increased dense gas fraction, and the evolutionary stage of such mergers may be another determinant of the HCN/CO luminosity ratio.},

	Abstract = {We explore the recoverability of gas physical conditions with the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) model, using the public code RADEX and the molecules HCN and CO. Examining a wide parameter range with a series of models of increasing complexity, we use both grid and Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods to recover the input conditions, and quantify the inherent and noise-induced uncertainties in the model results. We find that even with the benefit of generous assumptions, the LVG models struggle to recover any parameter better than to within half a dex, although we find no evidence of systemic offsets. Examining isotopologue lines, we demonstrate that it is always preferable to model the isotopologue abundance ratio as a free parameter due to large biases introduced in all other parameters when an incorrect ratio is assumed. Finally, we explore the effects of the background radiation temperature on CO and HCN line ratios, with an emphasis on the effect of the CMB at z\gt 4, and show that while the effect on the line ratios is minor, the effect on the spectral line energy distribution peak is significant and that the CO(1-0) line luminosity to H2 mass conversion factor (αCO) needs to be altered to account for the loss of contrast against the hotter CMB as redshift increases.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of interferometric spectral line observations of Arp 220 at 3.5 mm and 1.2 mm from the Plateau de Bure Interferometer, imaging the two nuclear disks in H13CN(1-0) and (3-2), H13CO+(1-0) and (3-2), and HN13C(3-2) as well as SiO(2-1) and (6-5), HC15N(3-2), and SO(66-55). The gas traced by SiO(6-5) has a complex and extended kinematic signature including a prominent P Cygni profile, almost identical to previous observations of HCO+(3-2). Spatial offsets 0.''1 north and south of the continuum center in the emission and absorption of the SiO(6-5) P Cygni profile in the western nucleus (WN) imply a bipolar outflow, delineating the northern and southern edges of its disk and suggesting a disk radius of ~40 pc, consistent with that found by ALMA observations of Arp 220. We address the blending of SiO(6-5) and H13CO+(3-2) by considering two limiting cases with regards to the H13CO+ emission throughout our analysis. Large velocity gradient modeling is used to constrain the physical conditions of the gas and to infer abundance ratios in the two nuclei. Our most conservative lower limit on the [H13CN]/[H13CO+] abundance ratio is 11 in the WN, compared with 0.10 in the eastern nucleus (EN). Comparing these ratios to the literature we argue on chemical grounds for an energetically significant active galactic nucleus in the WN driving either X-ray or shock chemistry, and a dominant starburst in the EN.},

	Abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle-0 observations of the CO J = 6-5 line in the advanced galaxy merger Arp 220. This line traces warm molecular gas, which dominates the total CO luminosity. The CO emission from the two nuclei is well resolved by the 0\buildrel{\prime\prime}\over{.} 39× 0\buildrel{\prime\prime}\over{.} 22 beam and the exceptional sensitivity and spatial/spectral resolution reveal new complex features in the morphology and kinematics of the warm gas. The line profiles are asymmetric between the red and blue sides of the nuclear disks and the peak of the line emission is offset from the peak of the continuum emission in both nuclei by about 100 pc in the same direction. CO self-absorption is detected at the centers of both nuclei but it is much deeper in the eastern nucleus. We also clearly detect strong, highly redshifted CO absorption located near the southwest side of each nucleus. For the eastern nucleus, we reproduce the major line profile features with a simple kinematic model of a highly turbulent, rotating disk with a substantial line center optical depth and a large gradient in the excitation temperature. The red/blue asymmetries and line-to-continuum offset are likely produced by absorption of the blue (SW) sides of the two nuclei by blueshifted, foreground molecular gas; the mass of the absorber is comparable to the nuclear warm gas mass (˜{{10}8} {{M}⊙ }). We measure an unusually high {{L}CO}/{{L}FIR} ratio in the eastern nucleus, suggesting there is an additional energy source, such as mechanical energy from shocks, present in this nucleus.},

	Abstract = {The ultraluminous infrared galaxy Arp 220 has been observed at 0.5" resolution in CO (2-1) and 1 mm continuum using the newly expanded Owens Valley Millimeter Array. The CO and continuum peaks at the double nuclei and the surrounding molecular gas disk are clearly resolved. We find steep velocity gradients across each nucleus (ΔV~500 km s-1 within r=0.3") whose directions are not aligned with each other and with that of the outer gas disk. We conclude that the double nuclei have their own gas disks (r~100 pc), are counterrotating with respect to each other, and are embedded in the outer gas disk (r~1 kpc) rotating around the dynamical center of the system. The masses of each nucleus are Mdyn>~2×109 Msolar, based on the CO kinematics. Although there is no evidence of an old stellar population in the optical or near-infrared spectroscopy of the nuclei (probably owing to the much brighter young population), it seems likely that these nuclei were ``seeded'' from the premerger nuclei in view of their counterrotating gas kinematics. The gas disks probably constitute a significant fraction (~50%) of the mass in each nucleus. The CO and continuum brightness temperatures imply that the nuclear gas disks have high area filling factors (~0.5-1) and extremely high visual extinctions (AV~=1000 mag). The molecular gas must be hot (>=40 K) and dense (>=104-5 cm-3), given the large mass and small scale height of the nuclear disks. The continuum data suggest that the large luminosity (be it starburst or active galactic nucleus) must originate within <~100 pc of the two nuclear gas disks, which were presumably formed through concentration of gas from the progenitor outer galaxy disks.},

	Abstract = {We used the Submillimeter Array (SMA) to image 860 μm continuum and CO(3-2) line emission in the ultraluminous merging galaxy Arp 220, achieving a resolution of 0.23'' (80 pc) for the continuum and 0.33'' (120 pc) for the line. The CO emission peaks around the two merger nuclei with a velocity signature of gas rotation around each nucleus and is also detected in a kiloparsec-size disk encompassing the binary nucleus. The dust continuum, in contrast, is mostly from the two nuclei. The beam-averaged brightness temperature of both line and continuum emission exceeds 50 K at and around the nuclei, revealing the presence of warm molecular gas and dust. The dust emission morphologically agrees with the distribution of radio supernova features in the east nucleus, as expected when a starburst heats the nucleus. In the brighter west nucleus, however, the submillimeter dust emission is more compact than the supernova distribution. The 860 μm core, after deconvolution, has a size of 50-80 pc, consistent with recent 1.3 mm observations, and a peak brightness temperature of (0.9-1.6) × 102 K. Its bolometric luminosity is at least 2 × 1011 L⊙ and could be ~1012 L⊙ depending on source structure and 860 μm opacity, which we estimate to be of the order of τ860 ~ 1 (i.e., NH2 ~ 1025 cm -2). The starbursting west nuclear disk must have in its center a dust enshrouded AGN or a very young starburst equivalent to hundreds of super star clusters. Further spatial mapping of bolometric luminosity through submillimeter imaging is a promising way to identify the heavily obscured heating sources in Arp 220 and other luminous infrared galaxies.},

@article{Scoville1997,
	Abstract = {We report high-resolution (1") imaging of CO (2-1) and dust continuum emission in the ultraluminous galaxy Arp 220. The CO (1-0) line was also imaged at 2" resolution for comparison. Both data sets recover essentially all of the observed single-dish line emission. Our aperture synthesis maps reveal for the first time, multiple components in the dense gas: peaks corresponding to each of the double nuclei (separated by 0.95" at P.A. = 101$\,^{\circ}$) seen in the near infrared and radio continuum and a more extended disklike structure at P.A. = 53$\,^{\circ}$, similar to the dust lane seen in optical images. Approximately two-thirds of the total CO emission (and presumably the H2 mass) coincides with the compact double nucleus region. The ISM associated with these nuclear sources is most apparent in the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission, but the brightest CO (2-1) emission is also correlated with the near infrared nuclei and exhibits a radial velocity difference of 250-300 km s-1 between the two nuclei. The latter is in excellent agreement with published near-infrared recombination line measurements. The observed velocity difference between the two nuclei is probably much less than their orbital velocity because the nuclei do not lie along the kinematic major axis of the inner disk. The elongated disk feature exhibits a monotonic velocity gradient parallel to the major axis of the CO intensity distribution with the highest receding velocities in the southwest and the highest approach velocities in the northeast. From the major/minor axis ratio (0.66), we infer that the disk is moderately inclined to the line of sight (i = 40-50$\,^{\circ}$).
Detailed modeling of the CO line profiles using a Doppler image-deconvolution technique, analogous to Doppler radar imaging, yields a best-fit CO emissivity distribution and rotation curve which are mutually consistent in the sense that if the total mass distribution follows the CO emissivity, then it yields the derived rotation curve. The implied CO-to-H2 conversion ratio is 0.45 times the Galactic value if the bulk of the mass resides in the molecular gas, rather than stars. This value is also consistent with that expected based on the likely molecular density and temperature in the nuclear disk of Arp 220. The total molecular gas mass for Arp 220 is ~9 × 109 M⊙ with an uncertainty of ~30% based on the line profile modeling. The peak gas surface density is ~5.8 × 104 M⊙ pc-2 at 130 pc radius, while the two stellar nuclei are at ~235 pc radius and at position angle midway between the major and minor axes of the gaseous disk. From the profile modeling we derive an intrinsic velocity dispersion in the disk of 90 +/- 20 km s-1 and thus a disk thickness (FWHM) of only 16 pc, assuming the disk is in hydrostatic equilibrium. With 5.4 × 109 M⊙ of molecular gas concentrated in the very thin disk associated with the twin nuclei, the mean density will be nH2 ~= 2 × 104 cm-3 (+/-30%), a value which is consistent with the strong molecular emission from high dipole moment molecules such as HCN and HCO+. From the high brightness temperatures of the observed CO emission (17-21 K), we conclude that the area filling factor of the disk is very high (~=0.25) and therefore the gas must fairly uniformly fill the disk, rather than being in discrete self-gravitating clouds. This thin central disk will have inward accretion at ~=100 M⊙ yr-1 due to viscous and spiral arm transfer of angular momentum. The line profiles at the positions of the double nuclei are double peaked suggesting that there may also be less massive accretion disks associated with each nucleus. The fact that the bulk of the molecular gas has relaxed into a disk with large masses of gas concentrated interior to the double nuclei is consistent with scenarios in which the gas in merging systems settles into the center faster than the two stellar/starburst nuclei. We suggest that dense central accretion disks like that in Arp 220 may be a common feature in the evolution of ultraluminous starburst/AGN galaxies since similar qualitative features are seen in the molecular line data for other systems (e.g., Mrk 231 and NGC 6240).},

	Abstract = {High-resolution images of H2 v = 1 - 0 S(1) and forbidden Fe II 1.64 micron emission in the luminous IR galaxy NGC 6240 are presented together with velocity-resolved spectra of these lines. The luminous near-IR H2 emission observed near the nucleus is generated in a shock resulting from the merging or collision of two gas-rich disk galaxies. High-velocity wings of the H2 line profile show the presence of shocked H2 at high velocities. It is concluded that the high-velocity H2 emission originates in material entrained in and shocked by a 'superwind' created in a nuclear starburst. The forbidden Fe II emission closely follows the stellar light and radio continuum emission from the nuclei and originates in fast shocks produced by SNR resulting from a starburst in the nuclei of NGC 6240. The total SN rate in NGC 6240 is estimated to be about 2/yr based on the nonthermal radio continuum emission. The low Br-gamma flux from the galaxy indicates that the nuclei are deficient in stars more massive than about 25 solar masses.},

These galaxies are the sites of exceedingly powerful bursts of star formation, as shown by (1) the luminosity and extent of the stellar component seen near 2 microns; (2) the large population of red supergiants required to account for the depth of the stellar CO absorption; (3) the absorption and emission features in the spectrum longward of 3 microns; and (4) the extended luminosity source indicated by the spatial extent of the galaxies at 10 microns. Scaled-up models similar to those developed for less luminous starburst galaxies are consistent with this hypothesis. Arp 220 also appears to have an active nucleus, possibly of Seyfert type 2.

	Abstract = {The infrared-luminous galaxy NGC 6240 has been observed using a long-slit near-IR spectrometer. The very strong 1-0 S(1) line of molecular hydrogen (H2) is extended over about 9 arcsec and shows a distinct component of emission extending to the south-east of the nucleus, with a velocity of about 300 km/s lower than the diffuse nuclear emission. Only very weak emission is found in the 5-3 O(3) and 6-4 Q(1) lines of H2, suggesting little contribution from fluorescently excited H2. Fe II emission, which requires stronger shocks to excite than the 1-0 S(1) line, is slightly more concentrated and displaced to the north of the nucleus and shows a different velocity structure than the S(1) line. No strong Br-gamma emission from the nucleus but some weak patches of extranuclear emission are probably detected. It is suggested that the strong H2 emission is due to slow shocks being driven into molecular clouds by the collision of the clouds with the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) of the other galaxy in this merging system.},

	Abstract = {H and K band spectra of the luminous far-infared galaxy NGC 6240 at resolving powers between 160 and 625 are presented. Line fluxes for six H2 lines are measured. The Br-gamma hydrogen recombination line is detected. The galaxy is found to be a strong source of forbidden Fe II emission. The v = 1 levels of the H2 are populated thermally at a temperature of 1300 K. The H2 emission appears to be coextensive with the broad-line component of shock-ionized gas that is seen optically near the nuclei. The strength of the B-gamma line indicates that the extinction toward the source is about A(v) = 3. NGC 6240 does not appear to be simply a scaled-up version of a bona fide starburst as in M82. Evidence that the molecular line-emitting region is rouglly twice the size of the continuum source indicates that the shocked H2 does not originate in young stars.},

The data are consistent with thermal excitation being the dominant mechanism in the nuclear region. UV fluorescence and associative detachment may also contribute to the fraction of energy emitted through molecular hydrogen transitions. The near-IR continuum emission appears closely associated with the two active nuclei. The morphological similarities between the near-IR images and the Chandra X-ray images indicate that the same mechanisms may be responsible for the emission in the near-IR and X-ray bands.},

	Abstract = {We have performed a long-slit K-band spectroscopic observation of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240. Spatially extended H_2 emission is detected over 3.3 kpc around the two nuclei. The peak position of the H_2 v=1-0 S(1) emission is located at ~ 0.3''-0.'' north of the southern nucleus. Based on line-ratio analyses, we suggest that the excitation mechanism of H_2 is pure thermal at most positions. We find the following three velocity components in the H_2 emission around the southern nucleus and its south region: a blue-shifted component (\approx -250 km s^{-1} with respect to V_sys), which is recognized as a distinct C-shape distortion in the velocity field around the southern nucleus; a high-velocity blue-shifted ``wing'' component (\sim -1000 km s^{-1} with respect to V_sys); and a component indicating possible line splitting of \sim 500 km s^{-1}. We show that these kinematic properties can be reproduced by expanding motion of a shell-like structure around the southern nucleus. The offset peak position of the H_2 emission can be understood if we assume that the shell expanding to the north interacts with the extragalactic molecular gas which has been transferred during the merging of the two nuclei. At the interface the cloud-crushing mechanism may work efficiently, and shock-excited intense H_2 emission is thus expected there. With this mechanism, the H_2 luminosity can be explained without global shock driven by the collision of two nuclei. All of these findings lead us to propose a model in which most of the H_2$ emission is attributed to shock excitation driven by the superwind activity of the southern nucleus.},

	Abstract = {We report on our new analysis of the spatial and kinematic distribution of warm and cold molecular gas in the nearby, prototypical, luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240, which was undertaken to explore the origin of its unusually luminous H2 emission. The gas components are known to be distributed between the two merging nuclei, forming an off-nuclear molecular gas concentration. By comparing three-dimensional emission-line data (in space and velocity) of CO J=2-1 in the radio and H2 in the near-infrared, we are able to search for the spatial and kinematic conditions under which efficient H2 emission is produced in much more detail than has previously been possible. In particular, we focus on the H2-emitting efficiency, defined in terms of the intensity ratio of H2 to CO [I(H2)/I(CO)], as a function of velocity. We derive this by utilizing the recent high-resolution, three-dimensional data presented by Tecza and coworkers. The integrated H2-emitting efficiency is calculated by integrating the velocity profile of H2-emitting efficiency in blue, red, and total (blue plus red) velocity regions of the profile. We find that (1) both the total H2-emitting efficiency and the blue-to-red ratio of the efficiency are larger in regions surrounding the CO and H2 intensity peaks, and (2) the H2-emitting efficiency and the kinematic conditions in the warm molecular gas are closely related to each other. We compare two possible models that might explain these characteristics: a large-scale collision between the molecular gas concentration and the merging nuclei, and a collision between the molecular gas concentration and the external superwind outflow from the south nucleus. The latter model seems more plausible, since it can reproduce the enhanced emitting efficiency of blueshifted H2 around the molecular gas concentration if we assume that the superwind blows from the south nucleus toward us, hitting the entire gas concentration from behind. In this model, internal cloud-cloud collisions within the molecular gas concentration are enhanced by the interaction with the superwind outflow, and efficient and intense shock-excited H2 emission is expected as a result of the cloud-crushing mechanism. The observed spatial distribution of the H2-emitting efficiency can be explained if there is a greater kinematic disturbance in the outer part of the molecular gas concentration, as a result of the interaction with the superwind outflow, and also more frequent cloud-cloud collisions in the region. In addition, the kinematic influence of the superwind on the molecular gas concentration should be larger at bluer velocities, and the collision frequency is expected to be larger at bluer velocities, explaining the relationship between velocity and the H2-emitting efficiency.},

	Abstract = {High spatial resolution observations of the 12CO (1-0), HCN(1-0), HCO+(1-0), and 13CO(1-0) molecular lines toward the luminous infrared merger NGC 6240 have been performed using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array and the RAINBOW Interferometer. All of the observed molecular emission lines are concentrated in the region between the double nuclei of the galaxy. However, the distributions of both HCN and HCO+ emissions are more compact compared with that of 12CO, and they are not coincident with the star-forming regions. The HCN/12CO line intensity ratio is 0.25; this suggests that most of the molecular gas between the double nuclei is dense. A comparison of the observed high HCN/13CO intensity ratio, 5.9, with large velocity gradient calculations suggests that the molecular gas is dense [n(H2) = 104--6 cm-3] and warm (Tkin > 50 K). The observed structure in NGC 6240 may be explained by time evolution of the molecular gas and star formation, which was induced by an almost head-on collision or very close encounter of the two galactic nuclei accompanied with the dense gas and star-forming regions.},

	Abstract = {We revealed the detailed structure of a vastly extended Hα-emitting nebula (``Hα nebula'') surrounding the starburst/merging galaxy NGC 6240 by deep narrow-band imaging observations with the Subaru Suprime-Cam. The extent of the nebula is ˜90 kpc in diameter and the total Hα luminosity amounts to LHα ≈ 1.6 × 1042 erg s-1. The volume filling factor and the mass of the warm ionized gas are ˜10-4-10-5 and ˜5 × 108 M⊙, respectively. The nebula has a complicated structure, which includes numerous filaments, loops, bubbles, and knots. We found that there is a tight spatial correlation between the Hα nebula and the extended soft-X-ray-emitting gas, both in large and small scales. The overall morphology of the nebula is dominated by filamentary structures radially extending from the center of the galaxy. A large-scale bipolar bubble extends along the minor axis of the main stellar disk. The morphology strongly suggests that the nebula was formed by intense outflows---superwinds---driven by starbursts. We also found three bright knots embedded in a looped filament of ionized gas that show head-tail morphologies in both emission-line and continuum, suggesting close interactions between the outflows and star-forming regions. Based on the morphology and surface brightness distribution of the Hα nebula, we propose the scenario that three major episodes of starburst/superwind activities, which were initiated ˜102 Myr ago, formed the extended ionized gas nebula of NGC 6240.
Based on data collected at the Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.

	Abstract = {We study the properties of massive, galactic-scale outflows of molecular gas and investigate their impact on galaxy evolution. We present new IRAM PdBI CO(1-0) observations of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and quasar-hosts: a clear signature of massive and energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in the CO(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates of several 100 M⊙ yr-1. We combine these new observations with data from the literature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflows within an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. We find that starburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their star formation rate (SFR), or even higher by a factor of ~2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed be effective in removing cold gas from galaxies. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, which is found to increase with the LAGN/Lbol ratio. The gas depletion time scales due to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosity of an AGN in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years in starburst galaxies down to just a few million years in galaxies hosting powerful AGNs. In quasar hosts, the depletion time scales due to the outflow are much shorter than the depletion time scales due to star formation. We estimate the outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful AGNs, it corresponds to about 5% of the AGN luminosity, as expected by models of AGN feedback. Moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 LAGN/c are common among the AGN-dominated sources in our sample. For "pure" starburst galaxies, our data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostly momentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds. Overall, our results indicate that, although starbursts are effective in powering massive molecular outflows, the presence of an AGN may strongly enhance such outflows, and therefore have a profound feedback effect on the evolution of galaxies by efficiently removing fuel for star formation, hence quenching star formation.
